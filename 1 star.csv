"Being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.

And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.

Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?"

SYNOPSIS

Detective Antoinette Conway and her sidekick Detective Stephen Moran are called out on what looks like your standard partner murder... but is something else afoot?

MY OPINION

........... *stares in what the fk?*................... Safe to say I am DONE with Tana French books. Someone needs to give me a Purple Heart for finishing this. My biggest gripe with Broken Harbour, was the absolutely insufferable MC, but ole Mick is light work compared to Antoinette. I always use DD Warren as my comparison when deciding if a character is cranky or should be sectioned, and without a doubt, Antoinette needs to be evaluated for possible psychopathy.

I think Tana is going for an anti-hero type of character like Kim Stone from Angela Marsons' classic police procedural series, but she leans a lil too heavy into the 'anti' part. I'm sorry but as a certified bitch(TM) myself, my jaw literally DROPPED when Antoinette called Aislinn, the 26-year-old MURDER VICTIM, 'fucking pathetic' because Aislinn wanted to find her father who went missing when she was just a child. According to the clearly well-balanced Antoinette, Aislinn and her mom should've 'picked up a new hobby' instead of obsessing over his disappearance. Oh, but it gets worser! Not only does Antoinette call Aislinn pathetic multiple times, she goes as far to call her a 'stupid bitch' for obsessing over her 'daddy fantasy' (again, just wants to know what happened to her dad). Are we actually okay? This is beyond 'someone needs a hug'. This is someone needs a STRONG prescription.

When Antoinette isn't shaming a dead woman for missing her dad (how dare she!) we're treated to her ruminating about who in the squad is trying to slowly poison her (paraphrasing). For someone who 'eats danger with a spoon' (LMFAOOOOOO), Antoinette is so paranoid it wouldn't surprise me if she believed the spoon in her tea was bugged and sending 'chatter' back to the lads. She loves to insist she's totally comfortable in her skin (while telling us we're all pathetic fucking losers if we're insecure), but doesn't fail to remind us every two pages that she's a rage machine because everyone is picking on her for have titties and off-white skin. Oh and how could I forget her using the word ""retard"" as an insult? In big ole 2016? The most self-aware thing Antoinette says is she doesn't believe in introspectiveness... but perhaps she should?

Tbh, if I got chopped up by CoHo and thrown into the Rideau River, I'd rather remain a cold case than have Antoinette assigned to investigating my death. Stay tf away from my decapitated body PLS!!!!

Other than one of the worst FMC I've encountered, this book was WAAAAYYY too long. The fact the audiobook is TWENTY HOURS should be a crime. Too much closed caption writing. Too many monologues. And too slow. It took forever and a day to get to the point, only for things to be wrapped up all easy, breezy in the last 5%. What????? Ugh. If you're looking to something comparable but with tolerable characters, try Sharon Bolton's Lacey Flint series.

PROS AND CONS

Pros: I finished

Cons: Antoinette is such a foul character even Ted Bundy would give her the side eye, too long, too boring, too abruptly wrapped up, too many descriptions of wind and how the air tastes

"I'm dying on the sword here... trying to get thru the last 3 hours of this book. Tana, Tana, Tana. Why do I keep falling for you? Yes, Yes, I LOVED ""The Likeness"" but I literally LOATHED ""Faithful Place."" And, ""In the Woods,"" the first one, had such PROMISE until the end which was like -- SERIOUSLY? You call that an ENDING?? And ""Broken Harbor"" was just so-so. Therefore, I consider it my OWN DAMN FAULT for even reading more of your crowd-pleasing non-plots.

Here's an analogy that I think fits well. Back in the 90's, I was newly married and we didn't have much money. Going out to eat was a big deal. Going out to a place that served SUSHI was an even bigger deal. I loved it so much. My newly betrothed didn't. And yet.... He still INSISTED on having one of my TWO pieces of RARE and WORSHIPPED sushi, only to make an ugly face and say something like ""Ew. I just don't get why everyone likes this so much."" To see half of my coveted sushi go down the gullet of someone who almost gagged made me so mad: ""THEN STOP TRYING IT EVERY TIME!""

I am my husband to Tana French fans. I know I probably won't like her new books. Yet I read them when they come out anyway, and then I gag and crap all over her in my reviews. I apologize. I need a 10 step supporter to keep me from pressing the ""order"" button I guess.

Her plots are non-plots. As in: WHO CARES?
Her characters are hard to like. As in: WHAT A BITCH/ASSHOLE!
Her drama/action contains no drama or action. As in: IT'S A JOKE.
I'll throw her fans a bone: Good dialogue & writing.

So, even though I am not even finished with this book -- and I mean, like, good LORD, how is she going to DRAG THIS ON another THREE HOURS -- I feel confident in this review. If anything changes, I'll be sure to let you know.

Update: I'm done. She really DID drag it on for an additional 3+ hours with literally not one more thing happening. Omg. Kill me. I'm so happy it's over."
Way too wordy! Goes on and on and on describing one thing. Couldn't finish it 
"Ughhhhh. I'm trying to finish this because I really want to know who did it, but it's HARD. The entire book so far, the 76% it's taken me a painful 5 days to read (and I'm a book a day girl), has been entirely about the main character explaining how EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS BOOK is out to get her. Every one. If she buys milk, the man would probably hand her the change condescendingly and she would analyze his tone for 4 pages while explaining why she can't tell anybody else because it would make her seem weak. I just want to know what happens... and I probably won't read another one of her books ..."
"All cozied up for a good read.

I love Tana French. I hated this book. It was actual work to get through the endless whining and what if dialogue. I would hate to be in Antoinette's head. I don't want to read about her anymore.
"
"Ohhh Ohhh. I can't even begin to put into words how much this book just pissed me off. Lets first start off by saying this book is an amazing cure for insomnia. Second of all this book had so much potential. Girl is dead and the task is to find the murderer. Half way through the book I said I was going to give it three stars because it was interesting but it dragged like holy hell. However, a 3rd of the way in it finally started revving up and I was like ""Okay, now I feeling what your putting down maybe you might just get 4 but not 5 seeing as I couldn't get over how much it dragged. Than our author decided to take a massive dump on the book because she must have used up all her energy making such a monotonous story line that she decided to end it where it was all for nothing and your left wondering is that it? Is that really all that is it? I spent 5 days reading this book for nothing and spent $17 on this books. So I am going to get my moneys worth. It now will sit by my classroom phone so I can rip the pages out and take phone messages on. Pass. "
"I normally like this author and find her original in her writing and style but this book was a huge disappointment. Her main character was a cop who I disliked throughout and my opinion did not change the end of the book. The book is just over 400 pages and could have been done and dusted in 200 easily. Her writing style was similar to those of this genre where she was 'too Irish' in her writing and it did not gel and was over played. Very repetitive at times and it all honesty, for me, the last 50 pages or so were worth reading but the rest was a let down. Based in Dublin in a world of a murder squad, it made you wonder what actually goes on behind those closed doors but in the end, you really did not care. She throws in a personal story about her past but never finishes it, which to me, felt like an unnecessary filler. Go back to your original ideas Tana - you are a good writer but this does not show off your skills."
I want the 3-4 days I wasted reading this book back. So tedious and drawn out and excessive. I found myself flipping through 2-3 pages at a time Bc it was literally the same stuff over and over. 
"What happened, Tana French? Your books used to be riveting, compulsive reads but your last couple of books have been lacking. This book was horrible. I HATED the protagonist, Antoinette. Well, ""hate"" is too strong a word. ""Detest"" is better. She had a chip on her shoulder bigger than Ma Rainey's bustline and she got on my last nerve with her grousing about her squad members. The plot was too convoluted and boring as well. I just did not care."
"Life is too short for this level of bleak and depressing. I used to love Tana French but I feel like she is trying to out-grim her other books. The Secret Place was bearable because it was a locked room mystery set in a girls boarding school, but this is more akin to Broken Harbour in the sense that I wanted to throw myself into one after reading about 60 pages. "
"I'm a HUGE fan of Tana French, but this installment in her Dublin Murder Squad series just didn't do it for me. Both the central mystery and the detective lacked the usual French sparkle. However, a 'meh' Tana French book is still head and shoulders above most mystery writers, which is why I'm refraining from giving it an actual star-rating. Really, Tana French deserves her own ratings system."
I am sooooo glad that I’m done with this book!! I should’ve known 50 pages in to stop reading. I’m not sure why others rated this book so high but I found it really boring and at times painful to read. It had an interesting plot but there was just so much unnecessary details. This is the second book by Tana French that I rated one star and at this point I won’t be reading another by her.
"Predictable plot and flat characters. I kept waiting for the twist that never came. The main character has an unconvincing come to Jesus moment. It also moved along slowly, especially for a murder mystery."
Meh -I finished it but I’m not even sure why – it wasn’t particularly interesting or well written 
"Great writing as long as you dont care about actually resolving a case, What a waste of time. Got drawn into this by what seemed like a case with little extraneous material. Guess I'm done with this writer."
"The Trespasser was another great read by Tana French. I found this detective a bit more of a challenge but French made it easy to understand her motives. Some of the victim's behavior was a stretch for me, but French made it easy to go with. The suspects, though, were more understandable and I found them to be much more interesting than the victim. I like how the characters in the squad are starting to dovetail between books - not take over each other, but provide deeper background and understanding of each. I also like how French revealed the solution. Not the ending I was anticipating - the who and the why, I had figured out right on cue, but not the final ending. As always, French's style is easy to read and fast paced. She reveals the depths of her characters naturally - not in a forced or obvious way. And there's plenty of depth. I can picture each of them and I feel like I'm right there, not just curled up in my chair reading the book, but actually right there shadowing the characters while they're revealing their stories. I can't wait to read the next in the series."
"I don't get the love for this book. The main character is insufferable, which dropped this down to 3 stars. And then about 3/4 of the way through I realized that the majority of this long book (20-hour audiobook) is actually just one extremely long-winded police interrogation/interview after another. And that gets worse toward the end. It's a lot of ""telling"" and very little ""showing."" That makes for a boring and tedious book, hence the 1-star rating. I won't be reading another book by this author. "
"Drags out for too long and lacks the necessary suspense. I don't feel like I got what I signed up for: it's more focused on squad politics than the actual mystery. The main character spends a good chunk of the story chasing down obvious false leads. Most of her investigation comes down to circumstantial evidence and guesswork so it's hard to suspend my disbelief. By the time she gets on the right track, it's just too little too late."
"The negativity and paranoia of the main character is more than I can take. I made it through about half of this book and I can say that more than half of the half I read is listening to Detective Antoinette Conway telling you how everything is sh... and everybody hates her. It is no wonder if they do. If she stood in front of me right now, I would tell her to get on some very strong meds."
"i finally gave up after 170ish pages. the only reason i read that much was bc i didn't have anything else to read, but i finally had enough and to HAD to shut it down.
it wasn't engaging at all.
it just went on and on and on and on.
and the main character was awful!! she sounded like she was trying too hard to be a cool, badass detective."
I tried this one out as an audiobook. Maybe it would be more palatable if I read it instead. It was wildly depressing listening to the tone and cadence of the reading performance. I am usually thrilled with audiobooks read with accents of the international locales in the novel. I also didn't realize this was in a series. I would have never started at number six if I would have known.
"Gave me a headache. For a crime mystery, it failed to create any intrigue for me. It had a very dull plot and exceptionally dull dialogue. The characters in the book made me want to literally throw it across the room. I have no good word for it!"
Couldn't finish. Yawn.
"spoiler....nothing happens
it's all in her head"
This book was an obligation;I started reading and had to finish. Period. A painfully dull story filled with unlikeable characters that could have ended 200 pages sooner!
"I tried so hard to like this, but it made me want to poke my eyes out, so no. No, I do not like this book."
"DNF @ 68% bc I literally could not care less if I tried

thought I’d read the witch elm after this one but maybe not"
"This book was ok. There were some confusing parts, the chapters were really long, and there was a lot of profanity. I might try to read another on of Tana French’s novels. "
"The Trespasser is, and I say this without a shred of sarcasm, the best sleep aid I have ever encountered. Two pages per night is all it would take to whisk me off to a blissful slumber.

As far as literary achievement goes...well, that's a completely different story. I should've given up on this book a hundred pages in, but something kept propelling me forward. Perhaps it was a naive belief that a work of modern fiction couldn't possibly be this boring all the way to the very last page, but alas! I slogged through it all though, cover to cover, which was a non-stop inundation of some of the most aggressively bland characters I've ever read in a novel.

In conclusion, I award this book 5+ stars for its ability to cure consciousness. Fair warning though--if you aren't looking for the literary equivalent of Ambien, I would highly recommend side stepping this one."
"400+ pages of absolute drivel.
Long and deadly boring interrogation scenes - without a lawyer present - may work in ""Line of Duty"" on TV, but not in a book. Nope.
There's so much wrong with this book, I don't know where to begin. The main character, Antoinette, has supposedly worked in the murder dept. for 2 years, yet she's as hardcore jaded as if she's worked 4876 homicides during the last 58 years. Check the statistics! There aren't that many murders in Dublin. This detail could be overlooked if the story had been good. But it's not. It is bad. It's stupid, uninteresting and unengaging. There is just not a story there. The bullying? Put that in another book, it doesn't belong in a whodunnit. And have Antoinette grow a pair and deal with her s***!
Who killed Aislinn? I don't give a dam! She was a stupid cow and she deserved what she got."
"Way too much language, the main character was such a whiner, and the ending was a huge let down. The protagonist goes the entire story with a huge chip on her shoulder which gets super annoying and ever other word is a swear word. I kept reading hoping the ending would make up for it but it was the most boring ending she could have come up with. No one really gets held accountable for any of their actions and it just ends. I didn't realize this was part of series, maybe it would have helped to start from the beginning, but I won't be wasting any of my time reading the rest of the books. "
"The book was just too long for the story the author had in mind. It was needlessly drawn out for pages and pages of drama between the detectives, bitching about higher authorities and the main character, Antoinette acting like an emo teenager the whole time instead of focusing on the murder and the clues. Most of the plot is spent in incident rooms and towards the end, the detectives get a sudden epiphany about the solution to the case.

It was on the whole a very dissatisfying read and also kind of annoying for a reader not familiar with Irish-english slangs."
If The Trespasser was a movie it would be entirely made up of two talking heads in each and every scene. Almost every scene is an overwritten repetative series of conflicting conversations between the characters with overwroght interrogation scenes that go on and on. There are few books that have been unable to finish but this is one of them. Half way through I began trying to scheme through the arduous dialogue but even then it was too much to continue with.
"I’d give it no stars if I could. Again, French needs an editor, at least 100 pages could have been chopped. I usually think the original story lines are good, this one just sucked.

Conway was a one dimensional character in the last book, so I expected a little more with her as the lead. French just left her drawn as a bitter woman, whose revelations about how wrong she was at the end fall well flat.

The mystery here is that there was no mystery. French dialed this one in."
"I know many love this author, and it is probably sacrilege to say I did not like this book at all. I thought it would never end. I listened to it as an audio book and found the detail and lack of action to be deadly. Maybe the print book would have been better, because I could have skimmed over much of the print version but with an audio book I was stuck listening to each and every single word.

I have read this author before and did enjoy another of her books, but this one not a bit."
A Richard and Judy top read I was really looking forward to this. Sadly I thought it was boring. It went on for far too long. I lost interest very early on and admittedly did skim read the last half of the book. It didn't engage me. I didn't gel with the characters. Left it at the pool for someone else to pick up and read- maybe they will enjoy it more than I did
"I was really excited for this book. I've read all of the other Dublin Murder Squad books and loved them. I'm a fan. This one though, flopped so hard. I'm so disappointed. All of the characters, the D's and the vic was unlikable. I had to skim the last 150ish pages, that's how bored and cumbersome it was. Hopefully it was a fluke and the next one will be good."
"I could NOT get around my intense dislike for the main character. Ugh, it became so tiring to walk through this with her. She has very few redeeming qualities and the story did nothing to make her more interesting or worthy of empathy.
"
"Sluggish! Warning this book includes; mediocre writing, a banal murder case, an underwhelming twist and uninspiring characters. This book also included every word uttered in every conversation that took place. Every slight development made is dragged out. Every police procedure is described in too much detail. There were not enough characters to keep interest - especially in terms of suspects. Half the book was dedicated to interviewing a lone suspect, who it was so obvious to the reader that they were innocent. Despite being a fairly complex and fleshed out character, Conway was boring and had such negative energy and aggression about her that I felt transferred on to me as the reader. It wasn't that I didn't like her but, I didn't like spending time reading about her. It wasn't pleasant. I had to force myself to finish this book and it was not worth it. If I could give my past self, or any future readers in that predicament advice. It would be; Don't bother. This is my fourth time reading Tana French. I've had varying degrees of enjoyment with her books but I'm sorry to say that I disliked this book so much that I think it will be my final time reading Tana French. "
"I was so excited and had such high expectations of this book, but unfortunately my expectations only led to disappointment.
This book was by far the slowest book I've read in a long time. The first 100 pages were an absolute drag, because they were centred around Antionette Conway - lead detective on the case - and what seemed to be her persecution complex. The constant negative narrative about how she is rejected and bullied by the men in the murder squad really took all the focus off the victim and the whole 'who dun it' approach.

I guess it's a case of personal preference, but I prefer not to read a book about office politics labelled as crime fiction. I didn't bother finishing The Trespasser, mostly because of the slow pace. After finishing the first 100 pages I tried my best to attempt the rest but I couldn't find any substance or appeal to keep me motivated. I decided to google the plot (I know, crucify me) to see if there is something to look forward to, but turns out the ending was quite predictable. At least detective Conway eventually realises that not everyone is out to get her. Yay for her."
"

Conway is annoyingly angry at everything and everyone all the time. I get that maybe that was the point? But it was too much. I almost DNFd after the first chapter because I did not like the main character. Steve was a loveable puppy and he is the reason I kept on reading.

The story was okay. Not gripping, kind of obvious, but in the end I still needed to know what happened? The ending was subpar too. You could see it coming from a mile away, and part of me kept hoping for a twist that never came.

And finally, this book is the definition of all tell no show. “I get a coke - for the caffeine, and a sandwich with lots of meat, who knows how long this afternoon will be.” Thank you for spelling it out to a tee. This book was about 200 pages too long, and left nothing up to interpretation or imagination.

"
"Probably the worst Tana French to date. Ludicrous plot, long, repetitive, tedious read, paranoid immature protagonist and unnecessary distractions.
Too much explanation, Antoinette giving the reader frequent descriptions of the squad, the dynamics, the moods, challenges....let the reader figure it out, we don't need explanations to create atmosphere.
Crazy plotting, gangs, mafia, cops on the take...Antoinette is paranoid and suspects every single person of trying to destroy her. Ms French typically creates a mood and atmosphere, even that was lacking.
Overdose of ""shite"", "" bolllix"", "" gaff"" and ""arse"".
"
"I know I am in the minority however I just could not give any other rating then 1 star. I have read 5 other Tana French books and loved them. I don't know what happened with this book. I tried to like it but the characters were annoying and the story was so repitive that I got tired of it and started scanned the last 150 pages.

Not my favorite Tana French book at all. Hope the next one is better."
"I've got to hand it to myself, I persevered, I made it through all 449 pages. For every word that's necessary to the story, there are five that are not. It's remarkable how much detail Breslin can go into about an experience that is not his own. Ditto Lucy. Wow. This is not to say that The Trespasser is not periodically entertaining. If it weren't, I would not be writing this poor excuse for a review now. "
"It took me forever to finish the last two chapters of this book (about a week actually). And those two chapters were not needed because you already know who dunnit way before then.
The lead, Antoinette is one miserable woman who really spoiled the story while her partner Steve on the other hand had no personality. No excitement, nothing.
Real waste of time."
"What a horrible and repetitive read. The only reason I kept reading was because it was on the list for book group. Total dislike for the woman detective... a negative person who truly needed anger management counseling. This apparently is a series, and since I've read none of the other books this one has not given me any reason to read the earlier books."
"The writing isn't disastrous per se, but the narration is way too wordy, way too drawn-out, thus the book is needlessly long. I kept expecting something interesting to happen, but that something just kept eluding me.

"
"I loved this series but hated this book. First, you don’t care who killed this girl. There’s no interest. But mostly because Conway spends the ENTIRE BOOK griping about how everyone is against her. She’s obviously paranoid and has a massive chip on her shoulder. Took me months to finish it because it had no suspense or interest like the other books. Very disappointing. "
"I picked this book up because I enjoyed ""The Searcher"" by the same author. Good, but not great, an enjoyable listen on Audible.
Detective Antoinette Conway, the main character in The Trespasser is unbelievably snarky, defensive and rude. I just cannot finish this book. She has no compassion whatsoever and it is hard to fathom the mind of the author in creating her."
"I like Tana French, but my god, this was BORING. Too many ""what ifs"" with fantastical theories that had zero basis in reality (well, the reality of the book.) Pages of telling people which jobs to do. Halfway through I had to give up because absolutely nothing was moving the story forward. I don't even care enough to flip to the back and find out who killed what's-her-face."
"Dragged for way too long. The suspense wasn’t even suspenseful. Too many what if’s that I don’t really care about, nor were they necessary for an “investigation”. Sometimes I had to wonder, is this how investigators spend most of their investigations? Coming up with the “what ifs?” And make a big deal out of them?
What a waste."
"I can usually put a book down and call it quits if I dislike it, but not with thrillers. This book just dragged on and on and the ending was so obvious it was boring. The characters were not likable. The Irish idioms were hard to figure out and the cursing was constant. It was a long read, and I am not happy I stuck with it."
"There were pages and pages of dialogue that was so unnecessary. You can skip those and never lose the thread. In the end, I don't believe I will follow this author. Disliked just about every one of the characters in this lineup. A lot of posturing, whining, paranoia and events that simply were not either interesting nor believable. "
"most unlikeable protaginst ive ever come across. the book was also full of fillers and pointless conversations, in the beginning at least, because i couldnt read through the whole thing. i skipped to the end and the murderer wasnt even that shocking. honestly, i read this a couple of months back and i dont even remember who it was, it was that unimpressive ;( "
"Didn’t actually finish. I disliked the main character. She was so angry, bitter, and self-destroying. I understand her situation and how lousily she was treated, but she really needed to let go and move on. A career move would have suited her, but instead she hung on and made everyone, including herself and the reader, miserable. Got as far as chapter 4 and quit."
"I cannot believe I'm giving my beloved Tana French a 1 star. But the way most of this book was a wild goose chase.. I was fuming! And the case itself is also absolutely boring. It gets interesting in the last 20% (the book, not the case; the case stays boring till the end) but that's too little too late.
Would've abandoned the book long ago if it wasn't by French."
"This book is hard to read. It is so slow that I kept telling myself that I can read 10 pages a day. Then around the 300 mark it picked up, but only slightly. It was written well, just the pacing was off. First and last book from this author."
"A tedious and repetitive read, and too little character progression too late. Maybe that was the point - get stuck inside someone's head for a few days as they investigate a murder and all the speculation that comes with it. But more editing would not have gone astray! "
I didn't like The Trespasser by Tana French. I had read In The Woods also by T French and thought it was okay. I read approximately 15% and didn't finish the book. I couldn't get into the characters or the plot. 
"I binge-read all six Tana French novels over the past six months. I know her go-to's--the light in the corners of the room crinkling, the case that threatens to end the main character's career--and it will be a while before I read another. "
"Reading this book was torturous. I thought I'd never finish it, but I did at last. None of the characters were likable or even interesting to me. I don't know that I will attempt any more of French's books."
"If you’d like to slog through a bajillion pages describing the boring and mind numbing data-gathering of a detective, then by all means...
Oh, and be prepared to read the word “f**k-all” about every 3 pages.
The ending...didn’t even care who had done it at that point."
Long drawn out storyI do not plan on reading anything from this author again. This was a long drawn out story about one murder. I only continued to read it so I could find out who did it. I skipped pages just to get to the end. Glad it's over.
"This was slow and uninteresting. Both the plot and characters were as generic as they come, for a cop murder mystery. Even the title is generic, with no specific connection to anything that happens in the book."
"Started out boring and got worse as it went along. It seemed extra long, but that could be because I wasn't enjoying it. Tana French is a hit or miss author for me. I've given full stars to Dublin Murder Squad, and now the least stars. So, I can't discount the author completely.

"
"Very, very disappointed in the early stages of this book. Unfortunately, I will absolutely never read a book that uses the R-word, ever.

I love the authors other works, but this was unacceptable and unnecessary."
I didn’t like it. I tried to read it. It was slow going. Then I skipped to the last few chapters. I found it a dark and unpleasant work environment. The intrigue was overshadowed. I didn’t find reading it worth the darkness. I like crime fiction but not this misery. 
"I’ve tried several times to finish this book, but the main character has such a chip on her shoulder that I can’t see past it. I’ve enjoyed other Dublin Murder Squad stories, but I’ll leave this one on the shelf for someone else. "
I honestly can’t believe this book has such a high overall rating. It’s been a long time since I’ve had to force myself to finish a book. This book has a decent plot but it’s way too long and has way too many pockets without any real action or intrigue. I was very disappointed. 
"Why was this book so long? Good enough story, but it just never ended. I sped-read to the end because I am stupid and thought it might turn around, but no. Next time let your editor cut A LOT out please. Super repetitive."
In the woods was better than this and I never thought I'd say that. I slogged most of it out because the premise appealed to me and I thought the writing started out good. Bland characters. I do not understand praise for Tana French. Many crime books out there that will be far better. 
Tedious -- until the twist 3/4 of the way through the book. I found that the dirty Irish slang made for particularly unpleasant reading: really overdone! I did enjoy the last quarter of the book. I just wish I'd known to speed-read the first 60-75%.
I couldn’t finish this. The main character spends more time whining about her colleagues and worrying about who among them is trying to sabotage her career or worrying if they might try to than solving who done it. She’s just annoying. 
"I tried REALLY hard to finish this book, but life is too short for this kind of nonsense. Soooooo boring. I fell asleep from it every night I picked it up. It could not hold my interest for any length of time. "
"Very disappointed ! Just could not get into it. It took me forever because I really didn't enjoy it, so read less often. Not like me at all ! "
I hated this book. There was so much hype around this book and I was excited to read it but it was too wordy and over written. The story was so boring. I was very disappointed! 
"Disappointing! I usually love her stuff, but this thing wasted my time and fell totally flat in the end. I want the reading hours back. "
"Very slow-moving and after 100 pages, I felt like nothing had really happened and I just didn't care anymore."
"This book was tedious and slow. Though others of hers are very good (In The Woods, The Likeness, etc.) this one was a bore. The protagonist was unlikable. Skip it."
Unhappy nasty. Vitriolic mean characters
Not good!
Disappointing- unhappy detective who feels way too sorry for herself makes for an unpleasant read.
Did not finish
Ugh what a waste!
Actually I probably shouldn't rate this book at all since I did not finish it. I was confused from the beginning and was never fully able to follow this story. 
absolutley NOT my style of writing.....couldnt even finish
"Dissapointing, rather dreary plot."
"Largo, torpe y previsible."
2016
"Ugh, this was a struggle to get through!!! Slow plot line, not enough character development, I was bored. This is definitely not my genre."
"Not Good

Very slow and drawn out. A bookclub selection from my local library. I did not enjoy reading this book and , hence, did not finish it."
Couldn’t finish listening. Too slow to unfold and not compelling enough to care at all who did it. 
"Drags on and on and never goes anywhere and nothing happens. One big boring book!! Waste of time.
"
"Ugh, I really wanted to like this book but I began dreading picking it up every evening. So....on to the next one!"
I loathe books written in the present tense. Even ones with a great twist in the plot.
Couldn’t get into it. Quit half way through.
It was painful to finish..it went on and on about nothing. This is the first book I’ve read by this author and may be my last. Others have said this one wasn’t as good as others...
Horrific. 
"This book was a struggle to complete. Antoinette is a paranoid whiner, and i will not read another book in which she stars. The plot would have been intriguing if the novel werre 200 pages shorter."
Good but too long. Didn’t finish 
Ну что-то как-то совсем не моё.
Read 50 pgs. Yuk! Don't read anything else by her.
Could not keep interest in this book. Too much stuff to think about and I just got bored. The narrator was very hard for me to understand.
This book could’ve been cut in half and it still would’ve been too long. Soooo incredibly boring and the main character was so unlikeable 
Got about a quarter into it and it was just so damn boring. I really liked in the woods so I wanted to like more of Tana’s stuff but I just can’t get into it.
Fell very flat for me. Hard time finishing it. 
"Fraco demais.Nem consegui chegar a meio.
Boring."
This book was so boring and the beginning contained too many logical fallacies. And it makes perfect sense FYI that someone would text their friend to be safe before a date
"Ughhhhh!
Annoying
Tedious
Boring
Gave up at 20%
"
"Bo-ring!!!!!!! And so full of profanity like that makes the female detective tough.
I got partway through and jumped to the very end. Very disappointed, as I really enjoyed her first novel."
Did not finished. Much too slow for me and too much speculation. The book was only taking place over a few days. I need more time than that. 
DNF - felt drawn out and half way through I was just so bored I couldn’t continue. Maybe it’s cuz I haven’t read others in the series 😭
I technically could not finish this book. I tried for about a month. I got a little under half way and i gave up. It was super boring and sloooooowww.. 
"I usually like Tana French's books. However, this one I just couldn't get into. I found the characters annoying rather than interesting."
Too long and nothing captured my attention. 
Hard to get into. Maybe try again. 
I found this book boring and kept skipping lines just to get to the point. I did't like the laguage nor the characters. One of the few book I was not able to read to the end.
"Um no. This is the most frustrating-protagonist, nauseatingly slow, anticlimactic thing I’ve ever read. Just no. Waste of my time."
dnf 
I really had a hard time finishing this book. It was way too long winded I would not recommend 
"I had a really hard time getting into this book, but I am not a quitter. I struggled through it and finished it, thats about all I will say."
I did not like the narrator at all. I slogged through half of it and just can’t anymore. 
Is this book ever going to end? It goes on and on and on. I’m too stubborn to quit at the halfway mark but honestly it’s boring.
"Slogged through this one, with characters I found very hard to care about, pouring the Irish on thick in interminable chapters that dragged on. Hard pass to any more of her books."
"I do not understand the great reviews, other than there MUST be some author/series loyalty.

It was a SLOW story. With an unlikeable heroine, an unlikeable victim, and an anticlimactic ending. I kept reading, thinking ""this HAS to get better... Maybe a plot twist at the end?"" No such luck.
"
"i hated this book. the first third of the book is a slog and i gave up, time is too precious to waste"
"To say I was disappointed in this book is an understatement. Clearly I struggled with this book from chapter two on. I kept waiting to get past the detective office politics/hazing and self-pity of the woman detective but unfortunately, the writer never quite got passed it. I felt like there was no thrill to this book no unexpected and quite frankly, I’m not sure the writer wanted to write mystery/thriller but rather a Informative book on the lives of detectives and threw in the three chapters about a murder to be classified as such. Twist, it is the cheating bad cop....really original. I read other reviews, I seriously questioned if they were reading the same book! I had to put this book down for days and then force myself to pick it back up! In the end I wish I would have just never picked it back up! I kept forcing myself to read on in hopes that there would be some twist some turn that would make it all worthwhile but that never materialized in her writing. For me this was torture all the way through!! Save your money & time."
"Where has the author gone who wrote the excellent novel ""Into the Woods""? Her last two offerings have just been horrific. I rated this particularly low because of the female protagonist who was beyond annoying. She whined, complained and was just a bitch the entire book. And the mystery? Not so fantastic if you've read her other novels, she used a similar tactic in another novel. Nothing original here. "
After looking at all the other reviews for this book that are 4 to 5 stars I am convinced we were not reading the same thing. I hated this book. It was so boring. Every time I would read it I'd just fall asleep. The whole entire book was just conversations and most of the time you couldn't even tell who was talking. I also felt like this book could have been half the size and there were times it mentioned things that had no reason to be in there. I don't recommend this book but if I did I would recommend just starting it from chapter 13 because that is when it starts to get semi interesting. I am surprised I even found the motivation to finish it.
"oh my GOD! the main character of this book is a miserable miserable human being. This could have been an interesting book but being in her head was UNBEARABLE. She was paranoid, angry and genuinely awful to every single person around her, including the DECEASED victim. I am really unsure what French was going for here, unless it was the create a protagonist so unlikable that readers would happily pick up the ‘Defund the Police’ mantle. "
"When does an unreliable narrator (or perspective character) become not just unreliable, but unbearable ... ?

My track record with Tana French is going rapidly downhill: I found In The Woods frustrating, but intriguing. I loathed The Likeness, and when I finished it, I felt like joining a class-action suit for compensation for the hours of my life that I lost on it. I really liked Faithful Place, as a picture of a working-class Dublin family and its neighbours-- but ultimately thought that the mystery was a damp squib, and very disappointing.

I picked this up in a charity shop, and it's charity shops that I blame for my misguided attempts to give authors who have disappointed me just one more chance ... (I don't blame ME: I am the innocent victim here, you understand ...) I think, everyone raves about her, she must have gotten good, worked out the kinks. But no ...

You might think I would enjoy this, as Antoinette Conway shares my weakness for doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Behave like a loose cannon, and suffer the professional and personal consequences of loose-cannondom. Rinse and repeat. Refuse to be a team player, and whine endlessly about being excluded from the team ... I read enough to decide that, however obnoxious and laddish her colleagues on the Murder Squad might be, a) what did she expect when aspiring to be part of the Murder Squad, colleagues with the temperaments and manners of Trappist monks? And b) she is herself obnoxious and self-centered enough that, however sexist her colleagues may be, perhaps just this once they have a point."
"Antoinette Conway is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad. She and her partner, Stephan Moran are given a case to solve by their gaffer. Aislinn Murray is dead in her own home and the book deals endlessly with Conway's feelings concerning how she is treated by her fellow officers during the first part of the investigation. As they attempt to find the killer, the plot becomes convoluted beyond belief. Even when the killer is finally revealed you don't really have the feeling that what you are reading is really the truth about the case."
"I gave up on this book 3 pages in, when she insisted on writing ""Me and Steve"" did this, did that or what ever, plus other grammatical abuses. Yes, she may just be trying to use a policeman's/policewoman's slang, but I really don't like intentionally abused grammar. Obviously, I did not finish the book. "
"Why are we supposed to think Tana French is amazing. This was boring, predictable, and suspense less. Awful. "
"This is the second Tana French I have read. She writes well but her central character in both books comes across as surly and sour, with no personality and not someone I feel connected to. The Dublin Castle Police Headquarters also sound smelly, grimy and unpleasant making the atmosphere in the book bleak. There is a lot of Irish jargon and I need to use Wiki Dictionary to understand some of the words. (Who knew that gaff means house and gaffer means boss!!) A list at the back of the book would help. The central plot is well articulated and enough to engage me but I wish I liked Antoinette, the lead policewoman more.

As the story unfolds the plot becomes a bit implausible. The murder victim has been setting up her killer to get revenge for what he did to her and her mother when her father went missing when she was a child. She does a total makeover with intention of attracting this man. What I found implausible is how she knew the type of woman who would appeal to him.

In the genre of psychological thriller with lots of twists to the tale it works, but in my view barely."
"I am really perplexed regarding what kinds of nice things I can say about Tana French's, The Trespasser .

What started out as an interesting case of murder that was lightly linked to an old case (and seemed to be building at a nice tempo) ended up being a book plagued by every tired red herring and cop cover-up you have read or seen on TV. Instead of having interesting switchbacks and curves in the story, I ended up with more motion sickness than anything...

This book made me wonder if Ms. French isn't trying too hard to milk this Dublin Murder Squad series past its natural end. (It will absolutely be the final one that I read.)

Should you want to read a much better book by Author French, be sure to pick up In The Woods. It was the first in the Dublin Murder Squad books, and a big improvement over this installment!

"
"I have loved this series by Tana French and was looking forward to this new book in the series. As soon as I started reading it I knew that it was different. I read 3 chapters, which are long chapters, and finally gave up. I am sorry to say I hated the character and the angle the story was taking. Antoinette Conway was presented as crude, aggressive and unlikeable. Because the writing ability of this author has been so good previously I would try the next book by her and hope that she has returned to her usual quality. "
"This was such a disappointment! The series has been amazing so far and this one fell so flat. Story line was extremely slow and never actually hooked me in. Also as much as I enjoy the character of Stephen Moran, the opposite is true of the main character Conway. I find her ""everyone is always out to get me"" attitude repetitive and annoying. I basically wanted to slap her in the face the entire book and yell ""it's not always about you."" I really expected so much more from this book, what a let down after waiting for it to come out. "
Maybe this is the Tana French book that finally makes me quit reading Tana French books. Ugh. It was much too wordy... talking at the reader instead of building a story. And man was the main character a whiner. The story line got lost in all of the kvetching about how hard life is for her. There wasn't much that I liked about this one. Not looking forward to the next... Hoping that I remember that when it comes out!
"If I could give a. 5 star rating, I would. This book is seriously boring, until page 250. Then it's just a little less boring. And the ending, like every Tana French novel, leaves so many unanswered questions. I think this will be the last book of hers I read, the last four have been straight up turds."
"While the story in itself was good, the author could have gotten rid of at least one hundred pages of nothing. After the case initially comes in, you are almost to page 300 before anything actually happens again. Wanted to pull my hair out, this book was so boring and loooooonnnggg.

This was my first book of Tana French and to be sure I will not be torturing myself with them again."
I abandoned this book about one third of the way through it. I was eager to read my first Tana French mystery as she comes so highly recommended. The premise of the book is a good one but the main female character just never made a connection with me and I could not sustain any interest in how she solved the murder. I'll try other Tana French books but this was not the one for me. 
I didn't finish the book
Not my favorite French book.It just went on and on and I lost interest in the story. Nothing redeeming about the characters. Story hard to keep up with. The main character was paranoid and whiny. It 100 pages too long!
". I enjoyed her other books but this one is disappointing. The plot is too scattered. Too many characters with no real role, so it was just another name to keep up with. And let's not even get in to the main character being paranoid and defensive. Blegh. "
This book was like watching paint dry or getting your tooth pulled. The first 300 pages of this book was just tedious to read but I stuck it out don't think I will be reading anymore of Tana French books in a hurry.
"I couldn't get into this book, I almost gave up on it a couple of times. I don't see what the big deal is about it or this series."
"I actually didn't finish this book, I quit about half way through. I thought it was repetitive, rambling and I didn't like the voice it was written in. Obviously lots of readers disagree."
Disappointed in this book. I loved the first three in the Dublin Murder Squad series. 
"Couldn't get started on this one, although I loved all of her other books."
"Absolute rubbish, too many mind boggling theories and no likeable characters. just wanted the pain to be over."
"This book was ""shite"". I skipped about 150 needless pages to find out who the killer was. I cannot understand all of the 5 star reviews."
Plot relies upon improbably coincidences. Narrative voice grated. Made it to the end with difficulty. Not for me. This can't compete with Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.
I found this book so boring I couldn't get into it. I'm putting it on hold until I can try again. Don't know why because i've loved all her books.
"good read

easy to read, good characters, will read more books by this author. could use a little more suspense. was good but not spellbinding."
I stopped reading at page #34. Life is too short. This is a typical police procedural novel; it's okay but can't compare to some of the literature I've been reading lately.
"Too wordy
Too long"
"NOT French's best work, by any measure. WAAAAY to much minutiae for my liking. IMHO, she tried too hard with this one. "
I did not like this book. True crime is not for Kiki. Classical English murder mysteries are for Kiki. 
plodding too slow to read. Did not enjoy at all
Had to stop a few chapters in. Could not keep my interest.
Reading this was incredibly slow and a waste of time. Even the plot twist at the end wasnt good.
Excellent. All the way to the end.
This might be the worst book I've ever read. I don't even know why I gave it one star it deserves a no star. I have no idea why this book is so highly rated. The story was boring there was no twist or turns--- just plain dumb. Do not read.
"I imagine that when someone tells me they don't like to read it must be because she read this mess. The story never moves. The plot is so slow moving and boring but not for character development. The characters are flat and the story stagnates. There is no meat to the story so the author repeats the same nonsense. Both story and characters are dead, without energy. They are making assumptions that are too obviously inaccurate to drag the story out. I get that detectives are hard but I cannot believe they are this nasty."
Got to 25% and couldn't go on. Very slow & repetitive. 
"I finally gave up reading this book. I felt like almost the first half or third of the book, all the main character did was whine. It got somewhat better after that, but not much. I finally just stopped reading it. "
"I'm in the clear minority here since everyone seems to love this book, and maybe it is my fault since this is my first Tana French, but it will also be my last. I found this book a chore to read. I didn't like the main character and I thought the mystery was not that interesting and frankly, and I didn't even care who did it."
"I don't know why I continue reading Tana French books. I end up not liking any of them. This one was the worst. It dragged on and on, I thought several times about just giving up on it. I didn't because I kept thinking it has to get better and it never did. I hated all the characters, I wanted to punch every one of them. The book is 449 pages long, it could have been half that."
usually love her books. This on never got off the ground.
"I'm quite disappointed, I was struggling to complete the book. I kept hoping that it would turn out well like all the other novel series but this is such a let down. "
"I loved the previous 5, but this one was just tedious! Antoinette is just so incredibly unlikable and it just dragged on and on. Ugh! "
"Anyone who knows me and/or reads my reviews knows that I rarely give one-star ratings and seldom abandon a book. Sadly, I just couldn't get through this and quit after 100 pages. The writing was simply too dense, leaving me with the distinct impression of slogging through wet concrete. In the end it simply wasn't worth the effort. "
I struggled to finish this. Just one of those books that if I put down I couldn't really be bothered picking up again! Didn't grab me I'm afraid...
I am a big fan of Tana French. Her best novels are Into the Woods and The Likeness. She is an Irish writer and her novels take place in Ireland so one needs to remember that the setting and characters are Irish. The Trespasser is an interesting detective novel; not as mesmerizing as some of her others but it has that psychological edge to it as do all of hers. Her novels loosely follow each other as they feature different characters from the older stories. Tana French has a talent for character development. Her characters are complex; with flaws and strengths. She makes it so easy to get to know each one and feel their emotions. The plot is also complex and has many twists. If you haven't read her earlier work - do so - you won't be disappointed!
