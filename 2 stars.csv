"Being on the Murder Squad is nothing like Detective Antoinette Conway dreamed it would be. Her partner, Stephen Moran, is the only person who seems glad she’s there. The rest of her working life is a stream of thankless cases, vicious pranks, and harassment. Antoinette is savagely tough, but she’s getting close to the breaking point.

Their new case looks like yet another by-the-numbers lovers’ quarrel gone bad. Aislinn Murray is blond, pretty, groomed-to-a-shine, and dead in her catalog-perfect living room, next to a table set for a romantic dinner. There’s nothing unusual about her—except that Antoinette’s seen her somewhere before.

And that her death won’t stay in its neat by-numbers box. Other detectives are trying to push Antoinette and Steve into arresting Aislinn’s boyfriend, fast. There’s a shadowy figure at the end of Antoinetteʼs road. Aislinnʼs friend is hinting that she knew Aislinn was in danger. And everything they find out about Aislinn takes her further from the glossy, passive doll she seemed to be.

Antoinette knows the harassment has turned her paranoid, but she can’t tell just how far gone she is. Is this case another step in the campaign to force her off the squad, or are there darker currents flowing beneath its polished surface?"

"Tana French is the New York Times bestselling author of In the Woods, The Likeness, Faithful Place, Broken Harbor, The Secret Place, The Trespasser and The Witch Elm. Her books have won awards including the Edgar, Anthony, Macavity and Barry Awards, the Los Angeles Times Award for Best Mystery/Thriller, and the Irish Book Award for Crime Fiction. She lives in Dublin with her family.

"2.5* The Trespasser is an in depth story with considerable detail on police procedural while attempting to solve a murder. Detective Antoinette Conway has been assigned a case along with her partner Steve, which could easily be just a domestic dispute or as Conway is hoping, a full blown serial killer on the loose; something she can really sink her teeth into. She has become quite paranoid lately in the department as other squad members pull mean pranks and are leaking sensitive case details she has been working on to the local paper. Detective Conway is a complex character with a lofty chip on her shoulder, a right mouthy gob that gets her in additional hot water, and is extremely reluctant to take any direction or suggestions from senior members. With the lengthy, thorough and detailed interviews with a suspect and witnesses throughout the book, it demonstrates how painfully slow it can be for detectives to take a small step in the right direction to solve a case. Conway at some point will have to decide to continue to gather enough evidence to convict who she believes is the killer or back off and roll with the best scenario she feels everyone in the squad including the superintendent wants her to take. Lots of dialogue and drawn out scenes will either keep the reader well entertained or put one to sleep. "
"Ugh, this was such a disappointment. A fairly uninteresting crime. A lot of early focus on someone who obviously didn't commit the crime. An uninspired wild goose chase that means that by the middle of the book, you still don't know much more than you did 220 pages ago. Absolutely ENDLESS conversations and very little action. Interviews with suspects where murder detectives' tactics are explained over and over and over again. A protagonist who was SO unlikable for so much of the book that when she finally had her redemption, I was well past caring. A LOOOONG conversation with the victim's best friend where she explains absolutely everything for us. An anticlimactic reveal and then pages and pages spent wrapping it all up. Major overuse of the word ""hole."" The only thing I liked about The Trespasser was the conversation at the very end between the gaffer and one of the detectives, but it was definitely too little, too late.

Don't get me wrong—a bad Tana French novel is still head and shoulders above most mysteries/thrillers out there, but by the standard French herself has set this is not a particularly good book, and definitely not gripping in the way her books usually are. My least favorite in the series by a very wide margin."
"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. I really did not like this book very much at all. I cannot believe I just wrote that about a Tana French book! Aaaarrrggh! It just felt way too forced on the ""psychological suspense"" front. WAY too forced. And it went on too long. And it was bleak and harsh and vulgar in all the non-redeeming ways. Well, every relationship has its ups and downs, and I still remain a big fan of our author. We'll simply acknowledge that this one didn't hit the mark for me. Doesn't mean I'm not already out here eagerly awaiting the next in the Murder Squad series!"
"This is the 6th book in this series by Tana French and it is also my least favorite for two reasons. The first reason was the accent in the audio narration. It was hard to listen to that for as long as this book was. I thought it was overkill not to mention unnecessary. So immediately this started out rubbing me the wrong the way. I don't remember the first five books being like this. The second reason is that this one lacked action. It was just a whole lot of talking about possibilities of what could have happened. The only action was maybe the driving from place to place to just do more talking via interviews or strategic talking. I don't like for stories in this genre to take this route all the way through. Because of these two things, this felt very very long. It took me so long to get through this.

No doubt, the author is a talented writer. I LOVE her way with words. She writes so beautifully. I just didn't enjoy the journey. So 2 stars."
"Started this with high expectations, due to French's reputation as a writer. And I do like her style--her descriptions of Dublin weather, streets and people; her use of dialogue, particularly when talking to suspects, make her an author I'll spend time with again. I'm not a big mystery reader; usually, when I go to this genre, I'm looking for a detective I want to hang with or a really good whodunit. Unfortunately, for me, The Trespasser stumbles on both of these counts. At first, I found Antoinette Conway, the only woman detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and the narrator of the book, interesting, feisty company. After a hundred pages or so, however, I began to find her more cranky, whiny and repetitive than feisty--yes, we know, it's a sexist murder squad and she's having a hard time. I was ready for her to start to have some realizations about herself and her own attitude long before she did. I lost patience with her. AND, I didn't even find the mystery that interesting. It was clear who DIDN'T do it from early on. I realize a mystery has to have alternative possibilities, but this book wasted too much time setting one up and breaking it down before it got around to leaving clues to a possibility that clicked. "
DNF. Loved the first four books in this series so much. Couldn't finish the fifth or this latest. Too much overly drawn-out explanations and a narrative that veers from the original story too much. I just wanted her to get on with it already. It was taking to long and I gave up.
"The less said the better. My first and as it transpired, my last Tana French. Just a poor attempt at crime fiction/police procedural."
"Sometimes, I try a new and popular author and discover that writer just isn’t my cup of tea. Tana French books will probably make it to the British television someday, and I’ll probably watch, but reading this one was just a slog for me. I was waiting for the end from the beginning of the book. The book was way too long for the content to carry any suspense. The whole long scenario of an Irish/Indian policewoman with a serious chip on her shoulder from the relentless discrimination and hazing she faced every day had not quite succeeded in making her or her male partner as dishonest as other detectives in her squad, but nearly as quick to make the evidence fit any hapless suspect. Chapter after chapter of implausible stories to fit up a rather helplessly unbelievable murder suspect, hoping to avoid offending the protective network of old boy cronies, was tedious and irritating. While this may be more like real life in some criminal justice settings, it isn’t why I read detective stories. The police woman’s final realizations that not everyone is out to get her, and that she can trust the system sometimes, comes after too much frustration to readers who have to endure her exhausting inner dialogue. I won’t be reading another by this author."
"Della serie” parlanni mali ma parlanni spissu”, la “Tana” ( che sarebbe l’autrice) continua a tirare frecciate contro gli psicologismi con cui, però, ammanta il debolissimo movente per il femminicidio di Aislinn Murray.

Sì, l’ho letto tutto.
Tanto, per farlo, non avevo bisogno né di atmosfere né di silenzio. Posso dire che ne ho letti di peggio ma fino a un certo punto, perché inutili come le ultime cento pagine mi è capitato di rado di trovarne.
"
"Aislinn Murray's ""new"" boyfriend, Rory Fallon (met in Wayward Bookshop), arrives for dinner, no one answered the door & he called the police.
Ireland Det. Antoinette Conway, assigned to Aislinn's murder, finds her body in the Dublin apartment ready to serve dinner. During investigations, Det. McCanni says he's guilty!! Conway finds its ""circumstantial"" evidence. A clue is Aislinn's father disappeared when she was a child & she was trying to find him.
Rory's proven ""not guilty"" & McCanni says ""close the case"". Conway believes another boyfriend was there or it was due to finding the ""missing"" father?
I was confused with the flow."
"Sad to say this but ""The Trespasser"" is the second disappointment from French. The tense, spare language of ""In The Woods"" is sorely missed. The literate intensity of ""The Likeness"" and ""Faithful Place"" is nowhere to be found. I doubt there will be any awards for this run-of-the-mill police procedural. Unfortunately, I will think twice before investing any more time or energy on the ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series."
"Tana French can be very, very good, but I didn't think this was one of her better books.

The problem for me was our point of view character. Antoinette Conway was introduced in ""The Secret Place"", where she met the POV character for that book, Stephen Moran. She was prickly in that book and she's worse here. I just didn't enjoy being inside her head.

The case is that of a woman who has been killed in her home, apparently while she was waiting for a date. Antoinette and Steve are working nights, mostly DV or drug stuff, and this seems to be run of the mill too, but maybe not? They bring in the boyfriend, are saddled with a more experienced detective to make sure they get everything right. I read about 125 pages and not much had happened other than the description of the crime scene and the interrogation of the boyfriend/date. Things felt like they were progressing very slowly.

A lot of the book is spent by Antoinette complaining about how badly she's treated by her fellow detectives. They seem to be a bunch of sexist assholes, except for her partner. She has a love/hate relationship with the Murder Squad. On the one hand, she holds it up as a shining example of perfection when it's running right. She gets a huge surge of adrenalin from working murder cases, questioning suspects, hunting. But she pretty much hates and doesn't respect anyone she works with and is just this side of exploding every time she walks into the office. It was exhausting to read about, and I can't imagine living with such tension every day. Antoinette doesn't have much respect for any human being, and to her it's all about not showing weakness and finding the soft spot of the other guy to turn to advantage. Not my thing, and I just didn't like her, to the point of wondering just how unreliable a narrator she was. Sometimes the unreliable narrator can be fun, but in this case it wasn't.

I skipped ahead to find out who did it. There had been no hint of the perp in the 125 pages I read out of about 450. When I like Tana French's books, it's because I hook into the narrator, can imagine myself in their shoes, find them sympathetic. I've liked reading about Rob, Cassie, Scorcher, Stephen. I have NOT liked reading about Frank or Antoinette, and their books are the ones I haven't liked. Well, better luck next time for me, I hope."
"It was an interesting story, but the main character's feud with the rest of the squad was pretty one-note and boring. Her ""angry at the world"" attitude became quickly tiresome for me as a reader. It would have been more interesting to get more background on why she feels the way that she does and make her character more multifaceted."
"I really admire Tana French as a writer and although there were moments when I couldn't put this book down, overall it didn't have the same tension for me that her previous novels have had. "
"Not one of my favorites, and I usually find Tana French novels pretty compelling. I had a hard time finding any empathy for the main character and found the crime unimaginative. "
"I'd like to have liked this more but it just exhausted me. I bought the paperback of In the Woods long ago when it was a bestseller, but despite many tries I just could not get into it. After reading that the mystery is never really solved I finally just gave up and donated it. But I hear so much about this series, I finally gave in and decided to give a random one a try. Since I wasn't going to read the first one first anyway, what's the diff which one. I thought this was well written, (despite the fact that I am obviously not so up on my Irish slang as I might have assumed) and certainly ""meaty"", but there was just too much of everything. Antoinette is too humorless and negative and gets picked on too much and the other members of the squad are too big of jerks too much of the time and there was too much detail regarding the victim and the suspects and too much repetition and by about page 300 I was really ready for it to be over. But there were still 150 pages to go. By then you know what happened, so end it, already! I'm not completely soured on this author but I'm going to need a long rest before I attempt another in the series. "
"Oh, I feel fooled! I love Tana French novels but not this one. Never did I care about the murder case the main character (Antoinette) was trying to solve. This was an incredibly long and slow read. And I’m fine with long books with dense dialogue. But it went no where, never moved the plot along, and was ultimately boring. I love detective stories that have partners working together. They never felt like partners and they did not have a life outside of work. They remained one dimensional as did the novel."
Oof this was a slog
"2,5* Um policial diferente que se centra não nos crimes mas nas personagens policiais, mas não me entusiasmou talvez porque como vim a perceber tardiamente este é o 6.º livro de uma série"
"Seriously, I was waiting for the twist at the end of the book. Didn't happened. Disappointing."
"Not her best and struggled to the end, by which point I had lost interest he who actually was the murderer. Pity as clever plot overall."
"Seldom do I read reviews before reading a book – think maybe this time I should have as I would probably have read previous books. I feel like I came late to the party; I really was not taken with this novel. Didn’t love it - -didn’t hate it After reading reviews I seem to be in a minority on my rating; could be because I have not read the previous books???? This was a tedious read for me. Found the characters rather boring and the ongoing issues/banter with Breslin, Moran & Conway seemed to get in the way of the story line. I did not find Conway to be very likeable. If you are planning on reading this one and have not read previous books in this series I recommend that you do so – maybe you’ll find the novel more enjoyable than I did. Gerri"
"Possibly this was a case of over-heightened anticipation, but the upshot is that this is the only Tana French novel I haven't loved. The protagonist was paranoid and complicated without ever actually being interesting or multifaceted, and that deeply affects not only the structure of the storyline, but also the reliability of the narration.

Then again, perhaps I simply wanted another Faithful Place."
"I keep trying to like this series, but I really don't. The protagonist has such a chip on her shoulder --and altho I know when she says ""Me and Steve"" did something or other, it is supposed to be colloquial and show her social status, it annoys the hell out of me. I did like the ending."
"Thought it would never end

This is the first book I've read from this author, and probably the last. Round and round went the plot, until I got to the point I no longer cared.
"
"Though there are a lot of positive reviews on this book, I would disagree with nearly all. I listened to the book (even on 1.25 speed) and that was a huge waste of around 20 hours. I’m not sure why I kept going, maybe for the hope that it will magically become better.
The plot itself was interesting, but I feel like the plot twist was cheating. There wasn’t that much going on, and i’m positive this could be condensed to a quarter of its current size.
This was such a bore to read (in my case listen), it just dragged on and on and on. Probably a couple hours dedicated to them eating sandwiches or making tea. And probably around half devoted to Antoinette Convey thinking about how the whole world is against her but oh no, she can’t tell anyone because then they’ll think she weak and dumb. I’m not sure why Tana French kept going on with the mystery, even after 2 hours I already couldn’t care less who killed the victim, maybe she was trying to reach the word count. It was more like word vomit, boring, bleak and useless.
If you want to read a good mystery, read Agatha Christie (the is a reason why she is world famous).
PS. I have read French’s “Secret place” , and in comparison to that, this was a little better (a least it didn’t contain fantasy and I managed to understand who each character is), but they both weren’t great (even that I think is being kind)
I don’t think that I’ll be reading her other book any time soon (most probably never).
"
"It was better than the last one, but then again so was a root canal. No joke the last one was awful. I said after book four every member of the squad couldn’t have a haunting childhood trauma that resurfaced for them to instigate, and I got my wish to my pained 20 hours of reading. This one was better than the fifth one but nowhere near as strong as book 2. What when wrong. Well police work is boring. Real police work is long hours of interviews and investigations. And you feel every minute of just how long in this reading. The audiobook is 20 hours and needs cut back to 15. There is too much repeating information. Yes, some witnesses share the same info but when I start to hear the same parts over and have to check if somehow the audio track go rewound then that is too much repeating. It all takes place in the interview room which leaves little room for action and way too much focus on one suspect—spoiler the wrong suspect. The detective become boring and so do we. This series started so strong with 4 top entries. And now I just don’t know if I’d read the next one with two disappointing entries. I had to force myself to keep listening and finally the last couple of hours there was a payoff. But I should want to listen and not have to wait for 17 hours for the story to get interesting. It seems to be a flaw lately in many of the new books I have selected. They need to lose a hundred pages and give a much faster pace to the story. I was not riveted, and I really didn’t care much for the detectives. This may be my last murder squad read. "
"Meh...

This is the first Tana French book I have read. I like mysteries and police drama. Reading this book helped me reflect on what I find enjoyable in a mystery book. I like a book that builds suspense, that has characters that feel real, or that have enough page-turning action that I do not care about plot holes or lack of character development. This is not a ""page turner."" I did not identify with or particularly like any of the characters. Some of the characters were very limited in scope, even cardboardish. It is heavy on police procedure. So, a plodding plot that may be indicative of real-life police investigations but did not capture my interest."
"I listened to this on audiobook, and 20 long hours later I am feeling free. So much of the narrative was the main detective ruminating over everyone hating her. And then in the end - she realizes maybe it was only two people who actually disliked her. Hip hip. The murder plot itself just didn’t justify the 20 hours of listening and the whodunnit reveal was so unimaginative. It felt like the book could have been done in 50 pages or less.

2 stars because the Irish reader served as a nice dialect coach right in time for St. Patrick’s Day."
A good plot ruined by the narrative. The book goes on and on about a suspect only to realise he is not a suspect. The police investigation was all about the two detectives talking to each other or thinking about each other. The character building was also not done well. I couldn’t understand if the author wanted the reader to like the protagonist or get annoyed at her. After going through the whole lot of unnecessary pages one character tells everything about her friend and then the killer pours his heart out all in the last 10%. So why go through all the 90% is beyond me. 🤷‍♀️
"In fairness to French, I’d say it’s at least 2.5 stars (max though)

Don’t get me wrong, The Trespasser is certainly not a bad book by any means. It’s just disappointingly the weakest in the series I’ve read so far.

Overly written and drawn out for (imo) absolutely no real plot or character progression. This was a book that -much like the investigation itself, tediously overanalysed and frankly mind numbingly dull to follow at times.

As I said, 2-2.5 stars max"
"I might just not be getting it but I thought there were too many stereotyped character to take this seriously. It took me until about 60% of the way through the book to start getting into the plot but up until then it just felt like a commentary on office politics, which had potential but I thought it was too extreme to take much of anything away from. I liked the other books in this series better (ESPECIALLY the first one). "
"Anfang und Ende sind einigermaßen spannend und Atmosphäre und Charaktere machen einige Längen wett. Aber alles in allem fehlt es an konkreter Handlung - der Mittelteil besteht größtenteils aus wilden Spekulationen des Ermittlerteams, die völlig an den Haaren herbeigezogen sind und jeder Grundlage entbehren."
My first and probably last Tana French. Just didn’t do anything for me. Maybe starting with book 5 in the series without reading 1-4 was part of the problem. I blame BOTM ~ they should have mentioned that when they feared this as a selection choice.
"Meh, really disliked the main character (tough-chick detective who swears a LOT and seemed really unrealistic) and kind of just read it really fast to see whodunit. I just grabbed this off my sister’s shelf bc I wanted something easy but I’m not sure I want to read any more Tana French. "
"I feel the same way about this book as I do about nearly all of Tana French's books - the writing is fantastic, and it's fun to read, but it just doesn't come together. I found this book to be particularly predictable and nonsensical."
"tried this, too much whining by protagonist for my tastes. gave up 3.5 hours in. this was a 20 hour book"
"I think her other books may be better than this one. Pacing felt really off, though I enjoyed it starting at page 300 (!)"
Hard work. V disappointed. I found the read slow and the central character tedious. Not for me.
Not really what I was expecting. Beautiful cover though. That's about all I can say good about this book.
Not a fan of the last two books
Lost a star because it depressed the hell out of me. I know that's not fair but I just wasn't in the mood for something raw and gritty and real.
Je ne connaissais pas l’autrice. C’est chose faite. Il y a des choses à dire mais je m’autorise une pause ! 552 page en une journée c’est suffisant. 
I am so depressed that I hated this book. French used to be one of my favorite authors but something about this book just kept making me put it to the side.
"I have heard wonderful things about this author, but I wasn't impressed with this book. "
"Nja, det här var ju en besvikelse. Bygger upp mot en superspännande smäll men efter ungefär hälften blir det pyspunka."
"I had trouble staying interested in the book and only finished it to see who actually committed the murder.
I picked the book up at the library not realizing it was book 6 in a series.
Not sure if my apathy was due to the fact I had to really focus when reading because I am not well versed in Irish slang or if I just did not like the writing style."
"Confusing. Could have been edited down a bit. Really got tired of the foul-mouthed, paranoid detective, Antoinette Conway, who is the main character. "
"I tolerated the mystery and suspense of this book, which was pretty good, but it was hard to not be distracted by how much I disliked the narrator. I didn’t find her a charming curmudgeon, I didn’t find her to be a softie with a tough outer shell, and I definitely didn’t find her funny. I found how angry and ugly she was almost intolerable."
"Tana French is a very good writer and I've read other books by her. I've finally realized with ""The Trespasser"" why I come away just not feeling satisfied. I just don't like the narrator or any of the characters. And that's because none of them like anything or anyone either. Antoinette is angry, seething, uptight, with a huge chip on her shoulder. I know it sort of becomes a plot point, but the thing I can't be sure of is if the author planned it that way, or we are meant to like this character regardless of her personality. And this is something all her narrators (and characters) seem to share.

Maybe it's cathartic for some readers to be immersed in such a world, but it isn't for me. It isn't that I can only read cozies and Jane Austen. I'm currently and obsessively going through Jack Reacher, have read ""The Dragon Tattoo"" series three times and ""A Song of Fire and Ice"" twice. I am not squeamish or against cursing and violence. But reading ""The Trespasser"" is like being in someone's head full of seething resentments, anger, scorn...I mean she just hates everything and everyone ALL THE TIME. And I think we're supposed to sympathize with her. Doesn't she get tired of feeling that way? I know I am tired after reading it.

So, good writing, good plot. But not enjoyable and it was a relief when it was over."
"Honestly, I'm baffled.

After hearing tons of respected reviewers rave about Tana French's writing style, saying that she speaks directly to their heart and is the best writer out there in terms of craft of words, I was expecting a lot more. I was expecting something along the lines of Janet Finch. I was expecting to be clutching the book in a corner, sobbing, with her words punching me in the gut (honestly, this is how people describe her writing).

At most, this was a mediocre crime story. Sure, it was well-written, but it was not masterfully done prose. Maybe I picked the wrong book to start with? I'll go back and give one of her other books a chance. But I'm at a loss here.

Other issues:

Plot: I knew exactly what we going to happen from the get-go. Down to very minor details. I don't read or watch the crime genre, so it's not like I'm an expert. It was just obvious.

Pacing: There was no anxiety. No pull to rush ahead and get to the next great scene. Sure, the main character experienced tension, but not in a way that drew me into the story. It wasn't exactly slow, but it wasn't engaging either.

Characters: This was the biggest problem for me. It's first person POV, but we never figure out anything about the main character. I don't know anything about her personal life outside of work. I don't know what makes her tick. I don't know why she's such a b*tch. 
In the end she doesn't even know why she's a bitch. She's all like ""Oh wow I just assumed everyone was treating me like crap and I had a right to bite everyone's head off, but it turns out I was wrong."" Since I never understood why she behaved this way from the get-go, this learning experience in the end fell really short of moving. I just thought ""Well duh, but why? WHY?"" The main character randomly calls her mom three times and spills a bunch of details from her crime scenes and then hangs up. No explanation about Any of this. Her mom hardly responds, so she's just this really confusing periphery character with no purpose in advancing the plot or fleshing out the main character's personality. SO FRUSTRATING. AND THEN. AND THEN! (spoiler ahead!) She has this major moment where her dead beat father shows up to find her for the first time in her entire life. She has about 2 pages of internal dialogue, says a couple things to him, then goes into bitch mode and bites off his head and kicks him out. THEN HE NEVER MAKES ANOTHER APPEARANCE IN THE BOOK. WTF. As someone who's never met my father, THIS IS NOT REAL LIFE. Sorry for the shouty capitals, but really, if you're going to give us personal details, at least make it flesh out your characters!

Lastly, there's the fact that the vic just conveniently happens to be a lot like the main character in too many ways (the father, no personal life, taking care of themselves...). I understand this as a way to provide contrast in character personality, but it just didn't work. Don't hit me over the head with it.

I'm tired. I need to go do something engaging."
"I wanted to like this book and did like about a third of it but the remaining two thirds were garbage. The main character was so hateful and un-redeeming that I almost put it down but out of the curiosity that I had for the ""good"" third, kept reading. She tried hard to put an interesting spin on the story towards the end but didn't quite sell it. I've read Tana's other 5 books and only really enjoyed the first two that she wrote. I suppose she and I will go our separate ways. Slán, Ms. French."
"If ""suspense"" means nothing happens for the first 11+ hours, this book was VERY suspenseful. Cruelly slow."
"I like Tana French's writing overall (some books more than others) and she can definitely weave an entertaining crime tale with engaging characters. But this book is not for Occam's Razor loyalists; that is all I will say about the ""reveal."" I worry that with more books in this series, the twists will continue to grow even more implausible."
"Well, the first Dublin Murder Squad novel that I didn't enjoy. The previous books were all four and five stars, but I could not get into this story at all. A lot of wasted words. And not I single character that I gave a shite about. And, boring, the worst the crime of all, worse than murder, aha.

You right enough books or record enough music, you bound to create some stinkers, hopefully this is just an downstroke for Tana French."
"Apparently this is the sixth book in a series but I didn't feel I struggled to follow the action despite it being my first Dublin Murder Squad novel. I frequently wondered what international readers would be making of some of the Irish slang - especially the cruder stuff.

A young woman is found lying dead in her front room, her face punched in and her skull smashed against the fire hearth. It seems like an obvious 'domestic' and her boyfriend is the obvious suspect, but Antoinette and Steve are almost hoping for something a bit more exciting than an open and shut case. Both are struggling with their roles in the murder team, Antoinette with a major chip on her shoulder due to some pretty nasty bullying. When a senior colleague is assigned to 'help' the two with their case, they can't help thinking something fishy is afoot.

I like a good murder mystery and there *might* be one here if the book were about 200 pages shorter. I've seldom come across a book with so much talk and so little action. It drags on and on and plods along like a drunk telling a story after too many pints of Guinness. Ludicrous 'what if' and wishful thinking lead the investigators to create multiple imaginary castles in the air - and to talk about them in far too much detail.

I can normally fly through a book of this genre but this one because a chore to get through. I had to get it back to the library before my holiday and couldn't just put it aside and come back to it. It felt like hard, boring work - the reading equivalent of the dull donkey work that the 'floaters' in the murder squad seem to spend their days slogging through.

We pretty much knew whodunnit and whydunnit a good 100 pages before the end. I have no idea why it was necessary to drag it out as long as the author did. I won't be back for the rest of the series."
"I’ve quite enjoyed Tana French’s other books, but this one fell flat for me. It also felt like her least believable book. Barely two stars."
"I adore Tana French's writing, but her latest novel is a letdown, plain and simple. It spends far too many pages delving into the paranoid interiority of its detective protagonist, along with the challenging squad room dynamics she faces, rather than devoting time on the case itself. The case is a compelling one, and the solution is straightforward enough and believable, but once the murderer is revealed, French plods through an overly lengthy conclusion involving the difficulties of pinning this particular murderer with the crime. All in all, the typically vivid prose, the layered characters, and the seemingly genuine and gritty portrait of Dublin that can be found in every one of French's books are not enough to rescue this one from itself. A bit of a disappointment, to say the least."
"Sadly, my least favorite of French's novels. I've written before about how much I enjoy her lyrical descriptions and interesting characters, but the descriptions here were cliche (brief moments of foreboding punctating the narrative at regular intervals) and Antoinette's narration was grating. There were a couple of nice suprises thrown in at the end, but also some plot twists that the novel would have been just fine without. I also thought French's resolution of one of the major emotional difficulties at the heart of the story was tone-deaf: I doubt many minorities find that their problems are quite so easily resolved. Fingers crossed for better book next time around."
"I know I am in the minority as everyone loves Ms. French's novels.
This is ""Dublin Murder Squad, #6.
I totally didn't get this novel.
Yikes I have reached my tolerance of nasty language stuff this week.
The election coming up Nov 6 and the TV is full of negative ads :(.
As I was reading this novel, and got to a sentence that had 3 f-bombs~ I thought why do people talk like this? (I know most readers don't notice nasty language)
To me there is far too much ugly nasty stuff going on.

Right now I I need to read a “fun” novel!!!"
"This was the 6th book in Tana French's Murder Squad series. In my opinion, this book was about 200 pages too long. It moved way too slowly. The main character was whiny, always angry and paranoid. The story itself was interesting, but it got lost and bogged down in all the needless narrative. I always enjoyed this series, but books #5 and #6 have not lived up to the first four."
"Completisimo el caso policial, con todo lujo de detalles, pero a mí se me ha hecho algo pesado y largo. Con la experiencia que tiene esta autora en novela policiaca, ésta es una más, muy bien documentada y que se lee deprisa, fácil de seguir. Como siempre, le sobran páginas, aunque Fench quiera justificar todas y cada una de las comas."
"this one was torture. the plot was uninteresting, the ending was meh, and the characters, well, could have been better ( better because she's nailed it thus far with her previous books). idk why, but even the writing seemed lazlily done which is unfortunate because I've loved all the other books which she's wrirten and the writing is what got me hooked."
Absolutely painful! The storyline was ridiculous and the amount of machismo you’re forced to endure page after page is almost unbearable. This will be my last Tana French book. I’d rather read an IKEA direction booklet. 
Yay! So tempted to pre-order even though I'm usually a dedicated library book reader...
"I still enjoy French's writing, but I was bummed that this one really didn't grip me. "
much better than no 5 but not as good as earlier books of the series and i felt this type of plotline was a bit familiar and not as well done as in books of this genre by different authors.
"I generally enjoy French’s books, but this one just dragged. I appreciate the craftsmanship and the up close look at the steps of an investigation, but this was too slow."
"Only redeeming factor is the writing. The rest of it was pointless, uninteresting, and I couldn’t give a rats ass about any of the characters and their ‘plight.’ Got a whole lot of nothing. "
"I don’t enjoy reading books in first person when I really don’t like the main character. Detective Antoinette Somethingorother is tough and harsh and mean and prickly. I know this because the toughness is shoved at the reader at every chance. I get it, she’s a bad ass m*therfu{ker and she doesn’t let anyone get to her. She and her detective partner, Steve, are investigating the murder of Aislinn Murray. It looks like a typical domestic case, but then Steve and Antoinette for some reason decide maybe she was involved with a gangster. (?!). I skimmed to the last chapters because I was bored and Antoinette was really annoying being tough and mean and solitary. The other detectives are mean to her, especially the senior detectives, Breslin and McCann, who’ve been around forever. But, see above about how she’s so tough — no wonder no one likes her. SPOILER: Aislinn’s father went missing when she was very young. McCann was on the case back then. Aislinn decides to lure McCann in and get close to him and find out what really happened. McCann ended up telling her about the case, not aware that she was the daughter. SPOILER: Aislinn’s father ran off with another woman. McCann decided not to tell them because he didn’t want to upset the mother even more. (WHAT? How does that even make sense?! The mother and Aislinn can’t handle knowing he’s alive and with another woman, but they CAN handle not knowing what happened to him and imagining all kinds of things? What?)After McCann tells Aislinn, she decides that since he decided a major thing in her life, she’s going to wreck his. She gets him to fall in love with her to break up his marriage. But then she meets a guy, Rory, that she really likes. SPOILER: McCann killed her because he was jealous of Rory. Aislinn worked on changing herself into a basic sexpot for A YEAR AND A HALF. And then she changed her ACCENT because she thought Detective McCann might connect her accent with where she grew up and that’d tip him off. BUT she doesn’t change her name. I think the name would be a much bigger tip off than her accent“She disentangles her legs from the striped blankets, puts her coffee cup down, opens the smoke packet and finds a cigarette and shakes the lighter. “ <— example of why I heavily skimmed.... Are the rules of grammar different in Ireland? All throughout the book Antoinette says “Me and Steve....” or “So me and Lucy....”. It bugged me. ."
"I did not enjoy this book nearly as much as I had anticipated.
Antoinette is a young cop working in the Murder Squad. This is her dream job... except that it's a living hell for her. As a mixed-race female in an all-white, all-male group, she finds herself on the receiving end of bad jokes, sexual innuendo and outright professional sabotage. But she hangs on by the skin of her teeth, clearing one domestic violence case after another with the help of her partner Steve.

When a young woman is found murdered, Antoinette and Steve are assigned to the case. It seems an open-and-shut case : the girl's new boyfriend is caught in numerous lies about his whereabouts on the night in question. Still, Antoinette and Steve continue to dig deeper, despite the strange interference of an older cop. Could there be a connection with the fact that the girl's father had disappeared decades before? What about the insinuations that she might have had a married lover as well as a new boyfriend?

I was disappointed in this book because most of it was about Antoinette's inner state of mind, and her emotional barometer was stuck at rage and suspicion. She hates her mom, distrusts her coworkers, feels stuck in her career, can't stand the press, despises the victim's boyfriend, and so on and so forth. Her paranoia just never let up - it's exhausting to read about people who seem to register only one or two emotions during an entire book. Similarly, there was so much bad language in the book that I ended up becoming desensitized. All of this inner monologue came at the expense of the mystery aspect of the novel, which was unexceptional, and, I have to say, not quite convincing. Finally - and this is a very personal feeling - I feel that characters who own bookstores have to be sympathetic, attractive, lovable human beings. It is just one of those conventions that I can't budge from ! I am fine with malignant lawyers, bumbling physicians, sadistic schoolteachers, corrupt cops and other unpleasant characters... but bookstore owners are sacrosanct for this book addict !

Bottom line : a book that's emotionally exhausting to read, without a satisfactory payoff in terms of offering an enjoyable puzzle.

"
"*1.5 stars*

Welp.... even with giving this two stars I think this was probably the worst Tana French I’ve read. I’m sure the one I DNF’d was better than this! This was just so incredibly bland that it was just frustrating to read by the end. If I had put my audiobook on a faster speed than 2x I would have!

There was no character development, the mystery went up and down and up and down in intrigue until just fizzling out! When the killer was actually found it I felt nothing! Any interesting concept but extremely poorly execution! Looking back at In the Woods, The Likeness, and Broken Harbor it makes me wonder what happened to all the characterization!! I felt NOTHING for these characters besides Conway (who surprisingly felt like a stronger character in the Secret Place, which wasn’t even her POV!). There was just so much in here that needed WAY more set up so when the “pay off” happened it just felt like nothing. How am I supposed to care about big events that happen to a character I know nothing about?

Maybe I missed some mentions of these characters at some point?? Even with this being a 20 hour audiobook I feel like we barely spent any time with them at all! Not to mention the mystery was just incredibly boring!! It had an inkling of some interesting quirks here and there: the entire house being immaculate and wiped clean, the stove being turned off with food still in, etc. but honestly.... nothing of intrigue really comes out it...

I debated on giving this 1 star or 2 for a while but... in the end I just had to go in the middle. You could still be glimpses of her great writing and characters every now and then and the mystery was interesting for a good while. And 1 stars I usually reserve for books that have both awful writing and characters and story But... this just sort of scraped by?? With the ending and relationship of Conway and Stephen Being what killed it for me. Stephen is still just as interesting as a wet piece of cardboard... this was such a disappointing way to end the series... not even sure it was supposed to be the end?? But it’s what we’re left with???? Thanks? I guess??? This hurts, man...

RIP (not actually dead though!) the good characters:Ryan, Cassie, and “Scorcher”. You deserved so much better Conway."
"Such a promising first 100 pages quickly turned into a dull slog through wild theory after wild theory until finally culminating in a glaring plot hole.


It really beggared belief that the murderer, Detective McCann--whose partner, Detective Breslin, was actively monitoring the ongoing investigation from the inside to ensure that McCann didn't get fingered--never put together that Aislinn had been involved in the Missing Persons case McCann worked ferociously years earlier (yeah, whatever, I know the author kept saying that Aislinn Murray was such a super common name, but he's a fucking detective, as the author also mentions eleventy million times)...especially when Breslin AND McCann had tried to intercept the box of information from Missing Persons connecting Aislinn to that case and Conway openly admits to Breslin that the connection exists, like, 200 pages in? I'm really, really supposed to believe that McCann had NO IDEA OMG HE'S SO SHATTTTTTTEREDDDDD in that interview at the end?

Plot hole beef aside, this just wasn't engaging. It's full of repetitive screeds on 1) how Conway feels paranoid/justified in her paranoia/oh, wait, no, not quite so justified (I'd have totally been down for a thoughtful inclusion of the ways in which a female detective is hindered by sexism in the force, but this was just so ham-fisted) and 2) what it MEANS to be a detective and how you can SMELL THE BLOOOOOD blah blah blah.

A full two-thirds of the story was just detectives theorizing on what might have happened; if you're looking for a thriller, look elsewhere, because this is straight-up procedural and not the best that genre has to offer."
"I listened to the audio version and """"shite!"""" it was fun to have the story told by a narrator with an Irish accent.

Not my genre preference so I may judge it harsher than others that like and seek out crime mysteries. A couple of people I used to follow on GRs highly praised the book and once I saw it was easily found on audio, I gave it a shot. It was nice to have something easy going in the background during chores etc..

The MC is a bit of a bitch with a """"they're all out to get me"""" attitude. The author justifies it as her being the only female in a male dominated profession that isn't too kind to her. Doesn't make her any less of a bitch. I'm not judging her, maybe I'd be a bitch too but I didn't really enjoy the cringe. She was all-knowing and just a bit too perfect also. Knowing what her """"bitchiness"""" would cause, knowing how to apply it just right. *eye-roll*

The story was way too long. Way too much running through possibilities. The crime & bad guy was unimpressive. (tho I could mourn a bit for the future the victim was working on) The info dump by the best friend near the end was ridiculous and the daddy plot seemed unnecessary except I guess to make the detective and the victim have something in common so the all too perfect cop could know exactly how she must have felt.

I wouldn't have read it all the way through without the narrator, or if I was to be curled up in bed or on the couch with the book. For background while doing dishes, balancing the checkbook, etc... it was okay."
"Good God. Thank God I'm done with this book. I couldn't wait to finish it just so I can write a review on this. I'm obviously in the dark- why is everyone RAVING about this book? I couldn't get through it fast enough.
It's wordy.
Golly, the author would take pages to describe one thing in the middle of an interesting scene.
The main character, Antoinette, has such a negative and loathsome energy about her that I got tired of reading from her POV.
And then the mystery. They just seem silly pulling theories out of the air based on nothing but their imagination. First they think gangs are involved (based on nothing but their fantasy to work an exciting case), then they believed it was Rory, a timid, bookish, man she was seeing based on the sole fact that he was seeing her. And then she makes a dating profile online with a fake picture she pulled from Google to ""catch"" a possible predator who may have been the one to kill Aislin.
I mean...where do these theories come from? They're based on nothing.
And in general, I don't enjoy books in the ""English"" I'm used to (US). This book is based in Ireland and so written with Irish English (is that even the right terminology?).
Gaff, gaffer....?
And their slang and syntax. Meh.

The culprit was interesting hence why I gave the book two stars instead of one.

The story started to get interesting at around page 170"
"While French clearly has a way with tight dialogue and dramatizing the interview room, I found this book, overall, to be a slog: a dreary, joyless novel that seemed desperate to show you the unreliability of its narrator at every turn and then expected you to be shocked when (surprise!) the narrator's perspective is unreliable! It's a familiar device of hers (I thought it worked rather well in ""The Witch Elm"") and can be well executed, but here it felt patently dull. Reading ""The Trespasser"" is to be barraged by a neat parade of red herrings and awkwardly-placed character development scenes that all amount to a rather pedestrian mystery that follows the conventions of its genre without much sense of fun and showing its seams at every angle. Sideshow attractions include crooked cops, shitty parents, mommy issues, daddy issues, spunky lab techs, and a ludicrous plot twist that, instead of reveling in its own absurdity, demands to be taken seriously. It is saved (somewhat) by some truly great interview scenes that are well-paced and brilliantly combative. They're begging for a quality screen adaptation, and if French ever ends up as a writer on a mystery show, I'd watch it just for her verbal spars. In the end, however, ""The Trespasser"" ends up being a dour femme-fatale story that tries to simulate depth while being about 150 pages too long.

"
"The Trespasser is a murder mystery novel with an unusual ending. It is different than a regular whodunnit, in the sense that the author puts a lot of effort in bringing out the struggles of the main (female) detective that constantly battles sexism and racism in her own squad. It is a unique and timely window of what it is like to be a competent female ,brown detective in an old boy's club. The struggle to find the actual criminal sometimes pale in comparison to the battle for survival within the ranks.

The book uses a rather frank, sometimes harsh tone to describe the inner world of the protagonist who is bitter, angry and sarcastic and rarely shows a vulnerable side. To the extent of barely feeling any sympathy for the murder victim. The male members of the squad are the stereotypical misogynists which sometimes feels a bit too cookie cutter, so far as character developments go.

The novel suffers in my opinion from being unusually long. Some of the witness accounts are monologues that just keep crawling across pages ,barely moving the story forward. The detours and distractions such as when the protagonist's estranged father walks into her life suddenly add unnecessary length to an already lengthy novel, without adding any juice to the central plot or theme.

Disappointing."
"I, myself, am guilty of taking too long when I tell a story because I enjoy getting every little piece of info into the telling. Tana French takes this to a new level. My patience for the author to get to the point drove me batty. OK, that said, if you are one of those very patient readers that enjoys the finest points in great detail, then you'll probably like French's writing. I recognize it to be quite good, if turtle paced.

This was my first book by this author. The Irish colloquialisms took a while to get used to, but became fun to explore. The psychological concepts going on with the two main female characters (protagonist and murder victim), their fathers leaving the family, got heady and too deep for me, and I felt it was obsessed about throughout the story and got very boring.

So, obviously, not a fast paced crime novel. If that's what you like, it's not here. I couldn't wait, and was happy to reach the conclusion, which was quite good, and satisfying. The gaffer surprises us, and throughout the stories corruption and unfairness, does the most righteous thing. Not sappy... just right, a correct, old fashion answer to an all around sad affair."
"I guess this is a police procedural, not a mystery or thriller? Likewise, I guess I don't like police procedurals - too slow. I felt like the first 200 pages could have been covered in 100 pages or less. The narrator has a big chip on her shoulder, which is part of the story but is also just tiresome after awhile. Too much of the story was relating what some character thought happened, what they'd been told had happened, or what they were maintaining happened. It reminded me of how much I hate books where one character (either the villain or the mystery solver) relates the entire chain of events in a monologue, or where the villain in a Bond movie tells Bond what's happening just before he leaves Bond in a certain death situation that Bond is going to escape from. In this book, we have the main suspects version of the evening, his imagined version of the killer's POV, and his revised and enlarged version. We have the detectives' versions of the events, told and retold as they get new information. We have the best friend's version of what she's been told by the victim prior to death. We have the stories told by the two cagey detectives in the Murder Group, and finally another retelling of the story between the department chief and the murderer. At least one of these is 30 pages. Just way too much retelling of the chain of events for me."
"I've enjoyed previous books by the author but did not enjoy this one as much. As others have mentioned, there is a lot of dialogue and not much action. I found the interrogation scenes a bit tough to get through as they went on much longer than I would have liked or thought realistic. I thought it felt a bit too convenient that their murder suspect would talk to them for so long without being told what was going on. I actually liked the main character- Conway, in the beginning, she was a bit mean, and cranky but it was understandable as she has had a hard time, but as the book went on it just stayed more of the same without learning very much about the character. There was a lot of guess work from the two detectives, whole chapters of them just throwing out guesses, I would have liked more actual evidence and some action, and more of a backstory about Conway, who could be a very interesting character. "
"I seem to be in the minority here, but I had a really difficult time getting through this one. I found the plot to be pretty slow, predictable, and it just kind of plodded along. I also thought the Antoinette character was unsympathetic and unlikeable which just made it hard to be invested in the overarching plot. I wish they had spent more time on Aislinn, maybe when she was alive, so we could have gotten to know her in her own words instead of through the very skewed perspective of Antoinette. I can usually get through a book in a day, and especially with thrillers will stay up to finish them. This one dragged on and on and I found myself reading it over the space of a week which is highly unusual for me. I think unless you are a diehard fan of Tana French, this is not worth your time. I'd read ""In the Woods"" and liked it enough to try another one of hers, but will probably pass on the rest."
"After reading The Trespasser I realized that I’m not a big fan of in-depth detective based novels. I love that stuff when it’s condensed into a dramatic 45 minute tv show, but in book form it’s dreadful and boring. I found Antoinette to be a very annoying and infuriating character. I didn’t find her to be the badass woman with a chip on her shoulder as the only female D on the Murder Squad. Instead I thought she was childish and paranoid and kind of a raging beyotch. I wanted a female lead to root for not root against. And the story was slow. The “twists” weren’t very compelling and nearly 3/4ths of the story centered around a random non-fact based theory about gangs that I felt came from left field. And Antoinette’s estranged father showing up? What a joke and waste of story. I did like the ending. The bad guy did get his in the end but you weren’t sure it would happen. But the whole thing was pretty predictable. Just not for me."
"I've now read all six books in the Dublin Murder series, and this is my least favorite of the lot (favorite is The Secret Place). This is mainly because Antoinette Conway is such an incredibly unlikeable character, it's impossible to root for her or care whether she succeeds or not, and as she is the first-person narrator, we never get a break from her. The way she treats her partner Stephen Moran is particularly detestable. Had the book been told from his perspective and narrated by him instead (as was The Secret Place) it would have been many times more enjoyable.

The central murder mystery was okay, but not nearly as engaging or interesting as some of French's other plots. I found myself just trying to get through the book, rather than enjoying it. It does finally get interesting in the last 150 pages or so, which saves it from being a total loss. Overall though, it's a weak link in the French oeuvre."
"Least favorite of the series, and therefore least favorite Tana French.

What went wrong, you ask? The characters. Conway was so disagreeable that I often sided with those against her. Only woman on the force? Solidarity sister! Constantly complaining and blaming and refusing to accept your own issues? No thanks. I wasn't a fan of Moran either. Really, none of the characters did it for me, which meant the book didn't do it for me.

French is a good writer. There were plot twists and I was genuinely unsure who to believe or which way the wind was blowing. All the parts that were pure investigation, interview, evidence were top-notch as always. But as soon as Conway started thinking or remembering or self-justifying, you lost me.

Props for the hands-down most believable ending.

I think it's time to reread _In the Woods_, if only to remember what it felt like to root for the detectives."
"I really disliked Antoinette. She was just angry all the time and on the verge of losing her temper constantly. Steve was just there as an emotional punching bag. It could have been believable if she was in her 20s, but in her 30s she doesn't understand where her anger comes from? She hardcore projecting on the victim of the crime who tried to find her father, without ever self-reflecting where her anger and lack of sympathy comes from. It is very disturbing that she is completely unsympathetic to the victims of crimes. Her anger issues undermine the investigations and are very unprofessional. Honestly, if Tana French tried to make a point about the misogyny at a workplace, this was a very unfortunate way to go about it. No one is required to endure this kind of antisocial behaviour at a workplace irrespective of one's sex (not endorsing of course the instance of sexual harassment and detroying evidence)."
"Wat a dissapointing trawl to the end from start to finish ,It's just nowhere near as great or good as all her others ,I was shocked ,it's preposterous at times ,like they muse and come up with silly theories based on er nothing but just oooh it cd be this ,even the characters say it after realising that er yes it was preposterous theory's with no evidence and a lot of the book is like that and when they do grasp onto somet it's based on er not much ,an no real evidence just guess work and circumstantial , a right bore ,I'm sooooo gutted as love this author and read all of hers ,I will continue to and hope this is just a one off dip in her usual well plotted story's
I also didn't warm to lead detective ,I don't mind unlikable characters ,flawed people but she just annoyed and grated me and was so negative"
"I started reading this book on holiday because I had tried to read before but just couldn't get into it and considering the good reviews on here and great writing style I thought I needed to give it a better chance than previous. Once I had got into it, the book took me forever to finish because I just lost interest half way through. The story itself was very good and as I was drawing to the end of the book I couldn't put it down. However I felt like it took forever for the book to get going. There was one point in the book where it took three very long chapters from getting a suspect into the interview room to actually going ahead and interviewing them. Overall I feel that this book was extremely slow moving, not gripping and in some parts very predictable. In the end a disappointing read. :("
"Not that good.

I've had a two year hiatus from reading and it has made me much more patient. If I'd read this two years ago I probably wouldn't have finished it.

Didn't enjoy being in the main character's head (too angry, too woe is me), didn't find the plot believable. The fist half went very slow, overall there was nothing exciting happening, no suspense, just a lot of going round in circles and then it was over.

The writing was good, and it managed to keep me sucked in, but there used to be a certain magic in Tana's work. This time it was gone, The Trespasser didn't make me feel anything (except mild irritation), and is utterly forgettable.

Overall, I'm disappointed, In the Woods and The Likeness were amazing reads and are one of my favorite mystery novels, I expected more from this one."
"I’ve heard only good things about Tana French, but this book was not it for me. It reads like a bad cop drama - and tbh I can get down with that. True Detective is my jam and I’ve been known to enjoy a few episodes of criminal minds. But there’s just something so tedious about this book - maybe it’s too procedural for me, maybe it’s just too meandering, or maybe the interpersonal relationships aren’t engaging to me. One thing is for certain, I find the main character Antoinette insufferable. She’s so bitter and petulant, and honestly just plain mean. Her righteous indignation flattens her into a caricature of a slighted woman cop. Which is disappointing because gender discrimination and sexism in the workplace is real and Antoinette’s character does a true disservice to the issue. Overall, I haven’t written French off entirely but this wasn’t the strong start I was hoping for. "
"You have to really, really want to get to the end of this book in order to put up with seeing into the supremely damaged and still somehow preposterously proud psyche of one of the most unlikeable characters I've come across. The 100+ pages of a single police interview did not help. Still, I kept reading because the mystery -- not just the death, but the character, personality, history and motivations of the victim -- kept me turning the pages. I sincerely hope most Dublin detectives are more Moran (the narrator's partner) than Conway, Breslin and that one other guy, but after reading several of French's novels now, I'm not so sure. Let's have a series based just around Moran being generally wonderful, eh?"
"La lettura di questo libro mi ha lasciata letteralmente esausta: decine e decine di interminabili pagine in cui non succede rigorosamente nulla, di dialoghi infiniti che non conducono da nessuna parte, di piagnistei della protagonista per il mobbing subito sul posto di lavoro, o di cospirazioni ipotetiche frutto di fantasie prive di qualunque aggancio con il caso di omicidio. Sarebbe stato apprezzato almeno l'inserimento di digressioni su tecniche investigative o approfondimenti in stile Karin Slaughter (da lei si impara sempre qualcosa su armi, procedure e dna), ma siamo ben lontani da quel livello di preparazione e scrittura. La spiegazione più semplice di solito è quella corretta, secondo il rasoio di Occam; in questo caso è la più banale, e 600 pagine di sole chiacchiere per arrivarci sono veramente troppe"
"It took me forever to finish this one. So the score isn't all that high.
When I need to force myself to keep reading, it's a bad book. But now I'm trying to figure out why I didn't like it. I think the main issue for me was the way it's written. Sometimes it was very confusing trying to figure out who was talking to whom or about whom. Too many thoughts, too many descriptions, too little action.
449 pages and it wasn't until page 310 that I actually wanted to keep reading.
Story was good, surprising (eventually) but it just took way too long to get there. And I was getting really mad at some of the characters so in general, not a good match for me.
Not sure if I'll check out any other of her books."
"I gave up on this book about half way through. I found the main protagonist, Detective Antoinette Conway, so thoroughly vile, I simply couldn't stomach anymore. Within the space of 15 pages, Detective Conway describes the young woman who was murdered and whose case she was working as: ""the brainless fucking bitch""; ""fucking pathetic""; ""that stupid bitch""; etc., etc. Perhaps Detective Conway is Ms. French's idea of a tough, no-nonsense broad who won't take any shit working in a man's world. Personally, I just found Detective Conway to be a mean-spirited, unnecessarily foul-mouthed bitch whose personality bordered on the pathological. I hate giving up on a book but sometimes it's better just to cut your losses."
"Tana French sure knows how to balloon what should have been a novella into a bloated novel: Identify a murder suspect, spin out interminable theories about his motivation, toss in numerous dialogues featuring intra-office bickering and resentment of authority, add some false leads, and include lots of lengthy interviews with suspects and sources. Once this project gets underway, the reader is set up to anticipate that the initial suspect identification may not be correct, 
as it apparently isn't.

Dublin detectives Antoinette Conway and her partner, Steve Moran, are well developed characters, but their interactions gradually become quite tiresome. The author seems determined to demonstrate that a female police officer can have a mouth as foul as that of any male colleague."
"This book took forever to read. The detectives get slapped with what appears to be a domestic violence murder, but really hope it is something more. There's little evidence but there's enough unknowns that they spin the case to be more than it is while keeping it on the low that they think this way. the main character Antoinette, because she has to prove herself or something, so she's just a huge bitch to everyone. I was so annoyed by her whole attitude that I just got sick of reading. Every single interaction took ten pages to get through. It might be that this is the only title of French's that I've read, but I did not enjoy it."
"More like 2.5 stars if I'm being honest. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I was iffy about reading this book since I really disliked ""Into the Woods,"" but the reviews and plot drew me in. While it's well written and a bit of a page turner, overall it was actually kind of a dull read. The narrator got on my nerves fast with her ""everyone's out to f*&% with me"" mentality which didn't lend itself well to the plot. It was so drawn out and took forever for anything to be revealed, and then when it was I just didn't care at all. I won't say I'll never read another Tana French book, but it's highly unlikely."
"I've finally figured out what I do not like about Tana French's writing. It is ENTIRELY driven by dialogue. Every single point of exposition unfolds through the main character's thoughts, feelings, and expressions. It is a very limited and limiting approach to writing. It means that a plot that could haven been wrapped up within a couple hundred pages in the hands of a more flexible writer, ends up blathering on and on and on as we wait for the protagonist to put A and B and C together to finally, eventually arrive at a woefully drawn out Z. I'm officially done with Ms. French. Until she learns how to present a story through more than just expository dialogue, I won't waste my time."
"This book really was not what I was expecting. While the plot and the actual crime were very interesting, I found myself frustrated with how detailed parts of the book were. I think this book is very much like the first book in the series. There are parts for the author goes on and on about things that truly do not matter. I found myself skipping paragraphs at a time. Again, I really enjoyed the crime aspect of the story and I never saw the twist coming but it was so hard for me to finish this book. Also, I really thought that the last book would tie all of the characters together since every book was written about one specific member of the team. Maybe there is another book coming?!"
"Ale jo, dala jsem to. I když jsem během čtení měla několikrát chuť odložit. Mně nevadí, že je děj rozvleklý, mám i celkem ráda nimrání se v detailech, pokud jsou propracované. Což tady opravdu byly. Ale! Hlavní hrdinka je prostě nesnesitelná! Lezla mi na nervy neskutečným způsobem a i když došlo k jakési sebereflexi na konci knihy, stejně to byla protivná mrcha a nenašla jsem v sobě ani špetku pochopení a sympatie.
Takže kladem zůstává skutečně propracovaná zápletka a hodně detailní psychologické rozpracování postav - ale všechno je to přece jen poněkud zbytečně roznimrané a ta protivná policajtka tomu fakt nepřidá..."
"Mystery books are supposed to be exciting and suspenseful; this book was neither. The pace was slow and the story developed almost entirely through conversations that the main character had with herself inside her own head or with her coworkers. Even the ending was terribly unsatisfying so much that my mind kept on coming up with ulterior theories right up to the last few pages, thinking at any minute it will be revealed that x y and z and I’ll be blown away... but nope none of that happened. It was tedious and boring and no reward for finishing it except the heads up to not read any more from this author."
"A disappointment. I have read three other ""police procedurals"" in the Dublin Murder Squad, and unfortunately this was for me the least convincing and compelling of the series. It's not a good thing for me when it takes two and a half months to complete what should really be a ""page-turner."" I just could not raise much interest in the particular crime or in the particular team of detectives set to unravel the case. Unfortunately, French relies on a few too many plot implausibilities for the final ""solve"" to be very convincing. The novel drags seriously in its middle parts, only picking up momentum in its final 70 pages or so. "
"This might be my last Dublin Murder Squad book. This book was just tedious. It was much too long and rambled on. The main character, Detective Antoinette Conway is angry, mean and hard to get alone with. The men in the squad have pulled horrible pranks on her but instead of getting even, she lets them get to her. Her partner, Stephen seems to be happy to work with him. They get the case of a woman who has died. Her boyfriend was expected as she was cooking dinner for him. But Conway doesn't think the boyfriend is the killer and she won't charge him until she is sure. This book rambles around and around, I was bored, but did finish the book. "
"Not actually a bad book, but I'm definitely grading on a curve based on the other Dublin Murder Squad novels (and the pretty great The Wych Elm and it doesn't quite measure up to the others IMO. Which is a pity because Tana French is usually my go-to when I want to read something kind of dark and extremely propulsive that I also know I'll speed through with delight. This is the longest I've taken to finish one of her novels—somehow this felt meandering in a way that didn't satisfy me—and the payoff didn't really work for me. Maybe I'm just not its reader! I dunno. She's still a damn fine writer but this one ain't it IMO. "
"I was disappointed. I've loved the Murder Room series but this one was not up to snuff.
A new female detective is the narrator. At first her cheeky and funny narrative was enjoyable, but her constant self doubt and snarky attitude toward everyone became tedious. She has reason to be wary of her fellow detectives but then her paranoia has her even doubting her partner who has been the only one supporting her.
Despite red herrings galore the culprit was not impossible to figure out, but the motive was slim and improbable.
The narrative was also too wordy, her voice grated by the end. I didn't care for Witch Elm either...hope French has more quality books in her, maybe not."
"Reading/listening to this book, I got a sense for how frustrated and bored jury members must feel. The level of detail in this book ( 20 hours listening.. so I had to switch to reading to get it over with) was too much. Adding to my frustration was how preposterous parts of the story were.

I disliked Antoinette ( I assume I was not supposed to ), but not to like ANYONE in the book, even the victim, seems extreme . Yes, the work environment was really toxic, but is no one decent? This book is not going to do much for the "" blue lives matter"" movement.

"
"I'm a faithful reader of the Dublin Murder Squad series, but the last few entries have just been, eh. On one hand, I really do love French's writing. But on the other, the plot has been thin over the past two or three books. This one follows the murder of a young woman as she sets up a romantic dinner, so her boyfriend is the ultimate suspect. The novel also goes into the inner dealings of the murder department. It could have been better if it were cut down by half and more to the point; the mystery and its payoff could have been more compelling."
"""The Trespasser"" is a wordy, over-long crime novel. I give it 2-stars but 2.5-stars is nearer the mark. The story takes place in Dublin. However, except for the Irish slang of the characters, it could have taken place anywhere. There's no Irish flavor or atmosphere otherwise. The story contains little action. The book's 449 pages are nearly all witness and suspect interviews spanning only the 4 days it takes to solve the case. Conway, the narrator and lead detective working the case, is not especially likable though you come to admire her determination and dedication. At times, the story almost becomes the exciting mystery you keep hoping it will be, but then the interminable dialog tamps it down. The ending works, but it isn't especially satisfying. I like my crime mysteries with a little more excitement and action. Maybe a car chase or gun fight. None of that here. But if you just want to read the details of how detectives investigate and solve a murder, this book is for you. Recommended with reservations (for being over-long and somewhat tedious)."
"As a detective story goes this was probably more accurate reflecting what really happens in a murder investigation, the frustration, the many theories and the doubt of the investigators. However, because of all this thinking and rehashing, the story moves slowly and is frustratingly boring. Half way through they were no closer to discovering the who than at the beginning. The author is very ""wordy"" and I finally gave up, went to the last chapter to see ""who done it"" and finished the book. Just not my kind of detail in a murder investigation."
"I became a fan of French's after her first novel, which is still my favorite. The novel before this one was really not good, but I liked the characters, and they are the main characters in The Trespasser. Nonetheless, as I was reading, I kept thinking--for the first time--that French really could use an editor. The plot is somewhat preposterous, which accounts for a lot of explanation. As always the descriptions of place and character development are great. But I almost put this down before finishing it."
"I was so surprised how little action or suspense there was in this book. I loved Her other books, which were all page turners that kept me up all hours. This one starts with a murder and then nothing else happens for the rest of the book except conversations--between the main character and others and her own very negative internal conversations. It was engaging enough that I finished the book and the ending was fairly satisfying, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if there was plot and action."
"This was my first book in this series; it was selected by another member of my book club to fit a genre we were reading. I enjoyed it and didn't expect the twist, though it was very hard to relate to the character at times. Perhaps if I had more of her backstory I would understand her behavior better, but she came across as so unnecessarily and unreasonably paranoid and nasty to other people, there were times that I wasn't able to muster much sympathy for the challenges she seemed to bring on herself."
I wanted to like this book because I've heard good things about Tana French but I just did not. I felt like it was dragged out for no reason but I finished it because I feel like I have to when I start a book. I felt like the book could have been written in less than the 400-something pages it was written in. I did not like the plot with Antionette's dad. I realize it was used in the ending to get what was needed but felt other than that it was highly unnecessary. I did want to know who had done it but even that was a let down as it wasn't very climatic when it was revealed. Not a fan.
"This is the second time I've attempted to read The Trespasser (first in print form, this time in audiobook form), and I'm stopping halfway through. I usually really enjoy French's Dublin Murder Squad series books, but this one was an exception, even with the fantastic audiobook narrator with the Irish accent that just adds a whole new layer to the book. I think maybe this book is too inwardly focused - too much focus on procedure - for me. Whatever the case, halfway through, and I'm just not invested enough in this book to continue listening...not even for the lilting Irish narrator's voice."
"My least favorite from French so far, which I hate to say since I *loved* The Likeness and really enjoyed the rest of the Murder Squad stories. This felt boring, lifeless, forced. The protagonist was written into such a heavy-handed cliche of a character that I found myself hating her. The mystery itself wasn't interesting at all. I struggled tremendously to finish this but I guess I cared enough to not give up which is the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one. I hope this is the low point in my relationship with French."
"The interviews of the suspects was annoying and bordered on police abuse; I can see someone confessing to anything under those conditions. The main character overdid her tough attitude; I get it; she is really tough. Basically the interviews took up a good portion of the book and there was little action. There were times that required a suspension of belief, like how they arrived to identify their suspects. There were some redeeming notes, like the personal relationships, though they were convoluted and erratic. Not her best, in my opinion."
"The Trespasser follows detective Antoinette Conway and her partner Steve Moran as they investigate the murder of a ""picture perfect"" twenty-something whom Antoinette recognizes as someone she has met previously.

After reading The Likeness and The Trespasser, I think I can say, it's not you, Tana French, it's me. The story just took too long to get going, and the alternative theories the detectives worked on didn't feel plausible to me. I tend to enjoy more plot driven murder mysteries, and I think Tana French's novels tend to be focused too much on character development for my interests."
"What do I think. Too many words. Yap yap yap. The protagonist is a bitch, the police officers/colleagues are awful. I don’t like any of them. Antoinette irritates everyone around her, but the author uses that as an excuse for the obnoxious behaviors of her colleagues. This author is famous, and she gets great reviews and I don’t understand why. The plot plods, the protagonist overthinks and feels sorry for herself, and witnesses are treated horribly. The disrespect and patronizing behavior of the police is just awful.
I will forget that I even read this within a week."
"it took me so long to finish this book... the story is kind of interesting but it totally doesn’t justify the enormous size of the book: it could be so much shorter. in addition to this, the main character is just annoying, I hated her throughout the whole story. the victim and the everyone is out to get me complex just pissed me off, and there were moments where she was super selfish and ungrateful.
if the book was in fact shorter, maybe I would give it 3 stars, but the non-relatable and the boring characters also didn’t help at all.
I recommend if you have lots of time to waste :)"
"An amazing writer with such incredible detail and accuracy in the language and even phonetics you are transported to another place. You can lose yourself in another persons perspective. But I struggled to keep pace. The main character is so unlikeable it was hard to get on board and the victim, you want to want to care, but was hard to really know her. She remains illusive - almost ethereal and it's such a long book with such long chapters, it was hard to stay interested. The writing is excellent but I couldn't appreciate the pace. "
"I enjoyed the earlier books in this series but I found this one disappointing and I kept putting it down so it took me several days to read it.

The story is told from the first person perspective of Detective Antoinette Conway who was a character in the previous book ""The secret place"". It also features Detective Steve Moran who had appeared in ""Faithful Place"" and ""The secret place"". Although Conway and Moran are investigating a murder most of the story deals with Conway's poor relationships with the other detectives in the murder squad."
"I thought I was in for a real cloak-and-dagger mystery and this is what I got: a book that takes place mostly in a dingy police headquarters, a limited amount of flat characters, a book that had very little action, and dialogue that went round and round and didn't move the story. Sorry, Ms. French, but I struggled to find bush this book. It looked so promising. And by the way, the beloved Stephen King wrote a snappy little review on the back... it's as if he didn't even read this book! Ugh."
"Not French's best book but twisty-turny for sure. Antoinette's a bit rougher around the edges than she needed to be in this one; angrier than normal. I'm not saying I don't like people moody, I do. But she was a bit off the rails and I was worried she might do something.. I don't know, desperate. Then things wind around...again and again. It definitely keeps you guessing, but it seemed too long, which indicates to me I didn't like it too much.... "
"While I like Tana French's style, I found this book way too wordy, in the uneven Irish dialect/dialog. And Antoinette really annoyed me in that she is so hostile to everyone. I just really have started disliking her personality so much that it ruins the story for me. Maybe that is Ms. French's point to make the female character so dislikable. I hope that her next book is more investigation and less about the flawed female character. "
"This probably a 2.5. My least favorite of the Dublin Murder squad. There is no one on the squad truly likable this time around. There have been strong female detectives in the past so I'm not sure why Conway is having such a hard time. No doubt the other detectives are truly dicks but why such a change in dynamic?

The story has such starts & stops it was hard for me to slog through at points. It did not have me on the edge of my seat as others in the series have."
"OMG - this went on forever. Needed to have about 1/2 of it removed. Two fairly new murder detectives are assigned to the case of a young woman found dead in her house. She had been plotting to make life miserable for a man who investigated the case of her missing father but who never got a full report back to the family. And she has recently begun to date a man with whom she really ""clicked."" Were either of these men involved in her death? That's the question the detectives try to answer."
"This just didn't seem as gripping and page-turning as a lot of people said it was. About halfway through the book I learned it was kind of part of a series and these characters had been in previous books. Maybe I would have cared more about them if I had started at the ""beginning"" with the series and had a back story on them. I held out, but near the end I was just working it get it done so I could start a new book. "
"I didn’t realize this book was part of a series until I was almost done, but I don’t feel like I missed anything by not having read the first 5. I listened to this book on audio and the narrator had a brogue accent which really added to the story.That said, some of the interrogation chapters seemed to drone on, and if I’d been reading I could have sped through them. Probably not inclined to read the rest of series unless I have a hankering to immerse myself in Irish dialect."
"Il clima di Dublino non predispone al buon umore. Persino i detective della Omicidi sono malmostosi e irritanti. La protagonista, poi, è afflitta da un vittimismo cosmico che dà fastidio anche al lettore. Il caso sembra semplice, si ingarbuglia strada facendo e trova una soluzione ben congegnata anche se priva di suspense. Resta per me un difetto insuperabile: 500 pagine per un giallo sono troppe."
"This was an audiobook version, as I am knitting and killing two birds with one stone.
Did not love this book...honestly, it was only at 73% read that I understood who had been murdered, but couldn't fill in the blanks.
Was distracted by the Irish narrator, and too much discription when it wasn't necessary.
Can't say that Tana French is going to be on my to read list this summer. I'll try again next year."
"It feels like 80% of the book is conversations, 50% of which takes nowhere. The storyline is frustratingly slow and can make you lose interest quickly since the protagonist herself thought the incident was boring.

The conversation with the gaffer at the ending is the best part. However, the ending did not give me chills or frustration (in a good way) like other books of Tana French, it gave me relief that the book finally ended."
"A decent, if dragged out, mystery with my least favourite kind of female protagonist - the one dimensional caricature. This woman feels out of place in a 'man's world', her only emotion is anger and everyone around her is a flawed a**hole who is out to get her.

I read a couple of French's earlier books and the plot and writing were fantastic. I would give this one a miss and try 'In the Woods' or 'The Likeness' for better enjoyment of this author."
"Hmm, this is my first Tana French Book. I’m 280 pages in and so far it’s talk talk talk about what might have happened to the “vic”. The first person narrator lays it on thick wallowing around in her anger and bitterness and paranoia. The prose itself is good but the content feels rather static. So very little has actually happened. I guess I’ll finish but I don’t know that I’m all that jazzed to read another TF book if this is what they’re all like."
"Halfway through, I was engrossed. I thought this book was so much more than a whodunnit -- I thought it was a sophisticated exploration of how workplace sexism led to paranoia and self-doubt that plagued a female murder detective's vital work. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. This is, at core, a whodunnit, with feminist elements largely abandoned for a solution involving crooked cops, ""pussy whipping,"" and daddy issues. Currently mourning what could have been."
"Tana French skriver dritbra, språket er fargerikt, handlingene er realistiske og karakterene velskrevne, men denne var rett og slett ikke noe for meg. Den ble litt for lang, gikk litt for tregt, litt for lite spenning og litt for mye politiarbeid. Krim for meg skal være rask, skummel, spennende og mye handling, og denne var rett og slett ikke det. Jeg klarte fint å lese den i stuen, på kvelden, uten gardiner, uten å engang begynne å kikke meg over skulderen, til og med. "
"It's a dread. Long-winded, stiff, coma-inducing drag that wastes over 200 pages on beating around the wrong bush; with Conway being the poor man-oppressed bitch all over it.

I don't want to pick another Dublin Murder Squad book ever - with the author's tendency to take an unlikable secondary character from a book and make them the protag in the next, where they are even more unlikable, next book is going to be insufferable."
"Couldn’t finish it. I don’t mind language in a novel, but when almost every character starts sounding the same with the same profanity slung as frequent as someone sips hot coffee, it just becomes annoying.

I’m sure she is a great author, I’m sure she can spin a yarn, but until the language is cleaned up, her potential may only reach high sales without every reaching classic status.

I may try another, but not for awhile."
I got this book on audible which may have been the issue. I see other positive reviews but I just could not get into it. I felt like the protagonist came across as whiny and paranoid and the story droned on. I had not read any of the previous books in the series - so maybe that didn't help either. I might give this author another look in the future but will skip the audible form. 
"More red herrings than a Norwegian canning factory. Felt like one long boring ""you know what I think.... Maybe...."" conversation. I don't mind all characters being dis likable but when they are dull to boot. Works way to hard to have the Irish dialogue sound natural and somehow it all feels off. Two clunkers in a row from Tana. Both felt forced and unnaturally convoluted. Done..."
"Uuuuuuugh. That was so disappointing. And exasperating. Felt like the longest book ever. I've been such a fan of Tana French and even the couple of books I didn't love I still enjoyed, as I recall. This one was kind of painful. The protagonist drove me crazy. It's not a total wash but not sure I could recommend it. "
"Jaysus if I read the word jaysus one more time I might have lost it.

This book was 300 pages longer than it needed to be. The first 250 were downright dull. It picked up towards the end, but pretty lame character development and reasoning all around.

Last, quite possibly the most brow beatingly Irish novel ever."
"Disappointed. I'm a long time French reader, so it pains me to say that. I don't know, I nearly want to call the book boring. What a boring crime, narrator, and point of view. There was no intrigue in the setting or plot.

As always, French has a knack for storytelling; it is just that in this case, the story sucked, not the telling."
"I think there was a really good story here, but the main character worked so hard to make herself unlikeable that I couldn't finish it. I didn't think any of the characters were very well developed so I didn't feel connected at all.
I didn't finish the book.
Maybe if I had read the earlier books in the series I would have liked it better."
Disclaimer: I have not read any books in the series so I had no relationship / affinity for the characters prior to starting this book. Felt like I spent half of the book bored before things got semi interesting and I spent the rest of the time trying not to hate the main character. Maybe if I had read the series from the start I would have felt differently?? 
"The suspense in the book suffered greatly from the ponderous, ever present self-talk of an unlikeable narrator with a huge chip on her shoulder. At 443 pages, the story wallowed along and could easily have been half as long with a lot more narrative drive. This may be the last time I read this author, as the problems with narrative voice here have been increasing since her 2d book."
This is my least favorite of the series so far. I knew the outcome 30 pages in. The character development is poor. The parallels between the detective and the victim lack subtlety. The pacing was painful. The only reason I didn't give it one star is French is a talented writer. This book feels like it was thrown together the meet a publishing obligation. 
"I've enjoyed some of Tana French's earlier books, and I guess somewhere in this endless 450 pages of blather, there is a mildly interesting story, but it's a long, repetitive, slow-moving slog. Since I hated it virtually from the start, I have no idea why I carried on to the end. Save yourselves! Don't make my mistake. "
"I’m not sure how I read this whole book. Sure, the skeleton storyline was a great idea. But literally zero of the characters are likable- including narrator. And the plot was entirely too difficult to follow. Which detective was screaming who vet? It changed every chapter. But I guess at the end, I somehow read it all. "
"In keeping with my habit of not finishing books I cannot get into, I have stopped reading this one. I normally find the Murder Squad books quite good, but honestly couldn’t get into this one. Didn’t like the characters and could not muster up much sympathy for the victim. Hope the next one is better"
"I loved the first couple of books Tana French wrote, but the last two books are just awful. I gave up with both of them after about 50 pages. I didn’t like any of the main characters. Couldn’t sympathise/like any of them. The stories take forever to get going. I wish Tana would go back to writing the way she did in ‘In the Woods’ and ‘The Likeness’."
"It was really hard for me to find a character I liked in this book- almost everybody had some attribute that I found very annoying. Also the plot was so painfully drawn out, I couldn’t wait for the book for end. These two factors combined left me feeling very agitated while reading this book! I’ve read other books by Tana French and I’ve liked them but this one was not my cup of tea. "
"I felt like not a lot was actually happening for the majority of this book. It started off well but after that the story seemed to be going round in circles. Also I found the main character Antoinette pretty depressing, she always seemed to be angry/moody for no reason. This was the first Tana French book I have read and will probably be the last as I really had to force myself to finish this! "
"Audio book. I would like to have given this a higher rating because Tana French writes an excellent story. However, she needs to learn that ""me"" is the first-person object pronoun and sentences should not begin ""Me and Steve."" Used once might have been acceptable, in dialogue, but throughout the book Antoinette Conway talked and thought about ""Me and Steve."" "
"Didn’t hook me and it was a long read. I could kind of predict the whole story but it took wayyy long to get there. Didn’t like the main character, felt sorry for herself and always had this crazy conspiracy that everyone is out to get her instead of a true hero female cop. Meh. Wouldn’t necessarily recommend it but I wouldn’t bash it either. Someone else might enjoy it but I didn’t. "
"I generally like Tana French’s books very much. Just not this one! From the beginning, the lead character was unlikable. And for me, that set a bad tone. It dragged and she just cursed and whined. Finally 100 or so pages in, I skipped ahead to the whodunnit. Even then, I wasn’t satisfied. Oh well, every now and then you get a klunker!"
"Takes some major suspension of disbelief. I like Tana French, but the tough-as-nails detective shtick got a little old as did the exposition in triplicate. Thing happens to advance the plot, main character's inner monologue about that thing lays it out again, two protagonists then discuss the thing, laying it out for a 3rd time. Oof. "
"Audio version of this book 📚-DNF wow this was a MASSIVE listen of over 20 hours and I only managed 5 hours !! The storyline was so slow with nothing really happening in those 5 hours so I was losing the will to live , the only good thing was that the narrator had such a lovely soft Irish accent it sent me to sleep 😴!! Whether the book would be any easier to finish I don’t know 🤷🏼‍♀️ "
"Thought I would never get thru this book. WAY too long. Could have taken out at least 150 pages. Possible crime theories wasting about half the book. I was looking forward to reading this as I had heard this author was good, but won’t be reading any of her other books. Prefer something Way more fast-paced. "
"This book has some flaws: the main character using the R word and the white author assuming she knows what it’s like to be a person of color (main character). I found the second the hardest to swallow. The angry woman of color with a chip on her shoulder trope was a bit much. The detective plot was interesting, kept me pushing through the story. "
"I love Tana French novels. I have read them all and loved them all, except this one. I find it boring, tedious and repetitive. The main character does nothing but whine the whole time. I keep trying to read it hoping it will get better. I am half way through and doubt I will be able to make it to the end."
"It took me almost two months to finish this book and I only could do it by skipping most of it and go to ending, and I usually have good passions for even meh murder mystery books.

It was meh and boring and way too long. This is the second book of Tana French that I read and wasn’t impressed with either. I don’t think that I will ever read any of her books."
"Just gave up on this book after I got about 1/3 into it. A lot of dialogue, but plot was not moving forward at all. And the main character was so filled with anger. although it was justified, I just got tired of such a negative vibe. The front of the book says it is “in-put downable.” I just put it down and I’m starting another book."
"Talk about over writing. Do we really need to know what direction the wind is coming from every time she goes outside? I found myself rereading paragraphs to find the point and alas there wasn’t one.

The last chapter was so anticlimactic I couldn’t believe I’d endured 448 pages for that let down."
"Another in the Dublin Murder Squad series. Too much detective angst and what ifs. The actual mystery was excellent, even if the conclusion was unexpected and somewhat unsatisfying. At the end of the book I realized I had no connection and very little sympathy or empathy toward anyone: victim, her friends or the cops.
"
"I'm giving up on the Dublin Squad after this one. Two detectives on the low-end of the totem pole are given a case of a murdered girl. Looks like a slam dunk for her new boyfriend, but they keep looking into the case and find inconsistencies. Just kind of dragged on with a lot of language and corruption. "
Aunque tiene algunos giros muy desconcertantes y el final es totalmente inesperado no me ha convencido ...Las situaciones no están bien descrita y a los personajes les falta una adecuada caracterización aunque lo peor es que le sobran muchísimas páginas y se hace muy lento y pesado que me costó mucho llegar al final.
"Bailed on page 192. For me, murder mysteries have to have a good pace. This one, although well written, was exceedingly S-L-O-W and not compelling enough to make me want to invest the time. I don’t need 2 page chapters but I do need a reason to keep reading. I really enjoyed the first two Murder Squad books, not so much the others. "
"2☆
Skipped 5 chapters to read the ending.
Boring, uninteresting, unpleasant, and unnerving book.
The main heroine is an incredibly annoying and spiteful woman who provokes zero empathy from the reader.
There was absolutely no mystery or detective line, just a weak attempt at psychological thriller."
"This is my second book by this author and I thought it was only okay. I’m glad I read The Searcher first because I really liked that book and if I had read this one first, I might not have read another one by this author. This was the first time I disliked a main character in a story before. The whole angry woman, everyone is against me, constant narrative was tiring. "
"DNF p. 120. Really plodding. An awful lot of bitching from female protagonist about: men making her life miserable at work, having an unwanted 3rd detective on the team, exactly why she doesn’t like the 3rd detective, trying to avoid the 3rd detective, trying to work with the 3rd detective. And somewhere between all this complaining there is a police procedural trying to come out. Ugh!"
"I found this incredibly boring. I was (perhaps mistakenly) expecting a thriller and instead got a very long police procedural with almost no suspense of any kind. There was some interesting insight into the psychology of witness examination, but other than that I had to really muscle my way through this one. "
"We only follow the main character who is self -absorbed, paranoid, and thinks everyone is out to get her. All the theories are completely made-up. I really hope this isn't how detectives work. From a small domestic issue to gangs? Crazy. The story just drags on even after you know what happens. And what was the point of Antoinette's dad coming in for two pages? Waste of time."
"When you're a rookie female Dublin cop in a toxic workplace, cynicism can lead to paranoia. Especially when your smug sexist boss hands you a domestic murder case and expects it closed toute suite. French is good at her characters picking their way through minefields, assessing gray areas. Here, Inspector Conway actually is given a chance to reassess things at the end, with a bit of hope."
"The reviews of this were fantastic, and I'm so sad that I didn't like it. It was a lot to slog through for not a lot of story, and I didn't care much for the main character. Glad I tried somethings new, but am not a fan."
"I love Tana French, but this was not good. I barely finished, it was rough. All about this one police detective's neuroses and barely anything about the actual crime. Also a lot of ""what if"" banter back and forth between the two partners. Not what makes a good murder mystery!"
"This was a long and tedious read. It started off fine and the ending was ok...but the middle of this book was sheer drudgery to get through. I finished it though, but it will definitely NOT be one that I remember. "
"Well I read ""In the woods"" and hated it. But I gave this a shot because it got such great reviews. I can now officially say I'm not a big fan of Tana French. This book dragged on and on and on. Her writing style is just not for me."
"2.5 guess I was in the minority but I didn't really care for this book. Many parts and long dialogues dragged on. The main character is super annoying- we get it, you're a tough girl cop. But calling the victim a ""stupid bitch"" for looking for her possibly dead father is over the top. Not a fan. "
"Usually I like Tana French. This one wore me out. I love a good police procedural, but I don't need to know every breath they take! After I looked at my friends' reviews of this book, I must have been in a bad mood when I read it. "
"If I had been reading instead of listening, I might not have finished the book. It wasn't bad, just drawn out, and not particularly exciting. It passed the time while I was on the elliptical at the gym, though. "
"Perhaps because I didn't read the others in the series, I did not love this book. I didn't even like it. I read it for my bookclub, and it was just not enjoyable. The pace was excruciatingly slow. "
"One of my least favorites in the series. sometimes in these murder mysteries, the author tries to keep the killer a secret so much that they fail to build his character. Once you find out who it was, you really don't care that much. I thought the story really dragged in the beginning too."
The setting of modern-day Dublin was interesting as was a modern-day murder investigation with all the impacts of technology. But the story dragged and I lost patience with the protagonist's chip on her shoulder.
"I had to struggle to read the first half of the book because it drug on so long without going anywhere. The second half was somewhat better, although I never ended up caring about any of the main characters. Antoinette, in particular, was completely unlikeable. "
"Tana French always tells a great story, with multidimensional characters. But after reading all of her other books, this one is my least favorite. It didn't have a single likable character. If the mystery had not been so compelling, I probably wouldn't have finished it. "
This was my first time reading this author and I won't be running out to find more. The book just seemed too long. It never really hooked me in. The characters were boring. The Irish slang seemed cumbersome. 
I didn't enjoy this book as much as the previous ones in the series. I know a lot of it was around getting into Conway's head and why she felt the way she did but it took until the last third to come together for me.
It took me three tries to finish this book. It started pretty slow and I didn't get into it until about chapter 12. I've liked all the other books in the series so I wanted to finish it. I'm glad I did but it was a struggle. 
"Well, not one of my favorites of French's by far. Didn't really like the main character, DGAntionnette Conley. Not very sympathetic and she felt too patently rough around the edges...maybe a bit overwritten? The story dragged a bit too."
"I took me forever to read this as I never really got immersed in the story. The Who done it part was engaging enough, but I struggled with the backstory about the politics in the squad.

I've read at least one Tana French book before and liked it, but this one didn't do it for me."
Way too much Irish slang. Do police really talk that way? French dwells over time on the paranoia of the lead character. The story finally got to be interesting when the plot began to come together. I stuck with this book because I did like her previous ones; this one not so much. 
"I just don’t get the hype around this book. I found it ridiculously drawn out, thoroughly unlikeable characters - yes, even Antoinette - and a ‘shock’ murderer so obvious he may as well have had a Belisha beacon on his head. At least a third too long and full of tired murder squad clichés."
"Bleh. Too much. Too much complaining. Too much unnecessary colloquialism. Too much anger and frustration. Too much paranoia. Too much feminism (yeah I said it). Too much victimization. Not enough character development for some key roles.

I want to love the main character, but it is overdone.
"
"Did not like any of the characters, especially the main one. She was not only unlikable but unnecesarrily surly and disagreeable. The story was excruciatingly slow and the ""resolution"" was unsatisfying. "
"Can't believe how I feel about this book. Loved her other ones, but I could't get into this one. I think it was the female character. I thought for most of the book she whined about her job and I felt it went over the top.
"
"A disappointing read compared to other books by this author. Long, repetitive interview scenes and reflective monologues by the main character become increasingly tedious leading me to skip large chunks of this over long (470 pages) book."
"I am a big fan of Tara French novels, but this one was a big disappointment The storyline was weak, as was the writing. I hope French’s next novel is much better than this one, or I will have to find another mystery writer....."
"It felt like reading a run-of-mill police procedural. There weren't any gasp-out-loud moments or big, shocking twists. I found the ending realistic and non-Hollywood, but I would've appreciated it more if the story were more engaging."
"I’m sorry I know most people rate this author but this my first (and last) book of Tana French’s - got to page 255 and literally nothing happening after the initial murder, nada in terms of any meaningful story just going round and around in whaffling circles - onward and definitely upward for me!"
Not my favorite of hers unfortunately. It was a little too much inside of one world is the spoiler-free way of describing it. And the main character wasn’t as believable as others I’ve read in her books. Too self-aware yet not. 
Normally I like the way this author develops her stories. But here I thought Tana was getting bogged down in the detail at the expense of moving along the plot. Taking more than fifty pages to describe the interview with a suspect was way too indulgent for my liking.
"I really liked all the other books in this series but this one was a let down. The unreliable narrator device is getting a bit old, as is the tactic of having most of the action take place in the narrator’s mind. An editor with a firm hand would have been helpful here. "
Honestly I’m not sure what all the hype was about. This book was so drawn out. It was like being on the longest and most boring rollercoaster ride. Okay there were a few unexpected twists and turns but for the most part it could have been written in half the words it was. Blah. Glad it’s done. 
Mystery is one of my favorite genres so perhaps my disappointment in my first Tana French book was that there weren't any surprises. I enjoyed the Irish narrator but Antoinette's negativity was hard to get into. It was a good peek into police work though.
"Story takes twists and turns, but felt slow. Had to push through to finish the story as I felt it never gripped the reader. The main character was a self loathing, crime fighter that personally made it hard to relate to or root for while reading."
"I’m finally done this book. Ugh. What a boring mess. The first half of this book were absolute torture - it picked up about half way through, but at that point I despised all of the characters so much it didn’t matter. Tana - what the heck!?"
"The last few chapters were really good. Wish a lot of the middle had been eliminated. I didn’t like how long and drawn out the storyline was. That, along with the very long chapters, made it hard for me to get through this book. "
"What-if-maybe crap is for weak people. It belongs to the ones who don’t have the strength to make actual situations go their way, so they have to hide away in daydreams where they can play at controlling what comes next. And that makes them even weaker."
"Maybe 2.5 stars. Antoinette and her delusions of persecution, cynicism, and anger issues got old really quickly. (Cue eye roll in first 100 pages). Fairly predictable and the ending wasn’t very satisfying for me. Not my cuppa. "
"Not sure why I did not enjoy this one as much as other Tana French books. I was mostly interested in the Conway/Moran professional dynamic, since we started that in The Secret Place, but there just wasn't enough of it here. "
"Had a difficult time reading this--the characters, especially the main character, are so unlikable that I just wanted to put it down. I did slog through the endless dialogue and slow movement to finish and found it just as unfulfilling, not a favorite."
The book lagged and never felt overly engaging. Not one of the characters was interesting or compelling. The story was predictable and lacked a proper twist. Sure the writing was solid and the dialogue above-average. But that is not sustainable for a novel this long. 
"This book was my least favorite of all the ones she's written. The ones with Inspector Harry Hole are so good and I can connect with the characters. This one, however, could just not catch or keep my attention."
"This book took me awhile to get through - I didn’t find myself intrigued enough to read it often. The mystery did start to pick up about halfway through, and with some free time over winter break + being sick, I forced myself to finish it. "
I wanted to like this but it just wasn’t holding my interest. The Trespasser is a police procedural/murder mystery book about a woman is who is found dead in her home and it appears someone bashed her head in. Unfortunately the crime wasn’t all that interesting and the storyline just dragged on. I found it to be slow and the dialogue boring and ended up not finishing it around 50%. I’ve heard the last 100 pages are page turners but I couldn’t make it to that point. Oh well!
An annoying protagonist verging on unlivable. Very long book that is predominantly long discussions of different scenarios of who committed the murder. Relatively unexciting ending. Only finished it because I was to stupid to stop reading. 
"The Trespasser

The crime happened off-stage. Then the rest of the book is endless rather dull wittering between the lead detectives on the case. Needed a lot more direct action and less chuntering."
"A really, really long convoluted book... A good editor should have tightened it up by a good hundred pages.
I'd have given up if I hadn't gone to a lot of trouble getting this from the library during lockdown 2."
"Far too much dialogue. Ruined a good plot with ridiculous conversations and interviews. If it’s a script for a movie it will need massive editing. Having just read her newest, The Searcher, this was a huge disappointment. "
"This is not among my favorites. There was too much foul language and it felt like a soap opera. I could get distracted for pages at a time without missing anything. It could have been a much shorter book, in my opinion. "
"Perseverance pays off

Like the protagonists in this book, the reader will ultimately get satisfaction by sticking with it. The story isn’t bad but the book was about twice as long and half as interesting as it could have been."
"I struggled with this one. Great writing, but too many conversations about nothing, with a long and drawn out storyline. I have read one other book by her and felt the same, so I have concluded that this author is not for me."
Loved the first book in the Dublin murders squad series and kept on going but the last two including this one have been exhausting in their detail. Could do without all the incomprehensible slang and the tough guy crap. No more for me.
After having read one of her other books that was a good story but way too long I thought I'd give her another chance. This book was a good mystery at first but there could have been about 200 pages less and it would have told a better story. Too much repetition.
"A solid mystery that dragged somewhere in the halfway mark - there were moments where I felt like we’d been running around in circles. Conway’s extreme paranoia, however, was a little grating to read through, and it makes me wonder how she managed to stay on the Murder Squad for so long. "
"I liked the characters and the overall plot, BUT it was way too long. I found myself wanting it be wrapped up and done. I would have given the book a higher rating if it was at least 100 pages shorter. The extra pages didn't add anything positive to me."
Overall not as bad as I thought it might be. I listened to the audiobook. But it was kinda frustrating how obsessed the main character was with herself and in putting blame on others for her lot in life or treatment by the other detectives. 
"I had to force myself to read this book, the main character was absolutely insufferable and the mystery only became interesting about 70 % in. I still really like Tana French's writing but everything else about this book just bored me to death."
"Non il migliore di Tana French: trama approssimativa, protagonista insopportabile, troppo esagerata nel suo ""essere tosta"", poco realistica. Steve amore della mia vita, unico personaggio umano. Finale deludente. Il fatto che mancasse Frank ha condizionato il mio giudizio? Probabile. "
"Too long. Twisted and some parts didn't really make sense. The one idea I liked was "" the story in our heads"". The idea that we all have a running story in our heads and part of our problems in life stem from those stories instead of what's really happening"
"This book is way too long!! Where was the editor? And, after all that agonizingly long wait, the ending was terrible.

I think the author suffered from the written version of “verbal diarrhea”! Although, knowing several Irish friends, they often use too many words to say very little."
It took me FOREVER to finish this book. Wasn't as grabbed by this one from Tana French compared to others I've read from her. It finally got good 3/4 through. Way to much time spent on parts that weren't relevant.
"I’m done with Tana French novels. First half boring and repetitive, zero character development. Stalker as usual, I’m done trying to like these books. Skimmed the last half. Should care about detectives and I don’t. Read Louise Penny books or Cork O’Connor books by William
Kent Krueger instead."
"Gave up after 1/3 of the book. Got tired of the angry female cop and the angry language. I don't mind bad language but I'm not fond of portraying women as ""hard ass."" We get enough labeling as it is and don't need any help from imaginary characters."
"The underlying plot of this novel was interesting, but the book was at least twice as long as it needed to be. It seemed to go on endlessly with unnecessary information. It would have been much better if it was about half as long. Not my favorite Tana French book."
"What a boring, slow read. I didn’t give a damn about the characters. It took forever to figure out who did it and the payoff was not there. I was on a roll reading this year and this book brought it to a grinding halt. Don’t waste your time."
Soooo slow. I really liked the main character Antoinette conway and characterisation was good. this is not a fast paced thriller and there feels like a lot to wade through. It does pick up pace at the end though. Slow going - not a thriller!
"Personally this book didn’t excite me like I thought it would. It was much too long for the build up (it felt like nothing was happening for a lot of the book), and the twist at the end didn’t grab me like I hoped. Not a bad book, but not my favorite type of mystery/thriller. "
"não adorei, a história é demasiado grande e não tem um final surpreendente, é algo que já se está a contar desde o início e é referido ao longo da história. e acaba por ser um pouco repetitivo, os momentos de interrogatório são bons mas em geral não é um livro que recomende a leitura"
"Slow and very long. I listened to this story, which was good because not much happened. Loved the accent of the narrator. But this book could have been shorter. The ending was anticlimactic - no twist or surprise. So 20 hours of listening, for a quick ""I did it""."
"I love Tana French, but this one missed the mark. Like wading through mud, it was way too meticulous and slow moving and the ending wasn’t even a shocker, but something the reader figures out halfway through. I love the way Tana writes, but the story just fell flat."
"Abbreviation please

I feel like I’ve wasted hours on this story. Yes it had a good plot and characters developed beyond necessity but, oh my, did it take so many paragraphs, pages, and chapters to do so?"
"Das schwächste Werk von Tana French bislang. Ich musste mich geradezu etwas hindurch quälen. Es war einfach viel zu lang gezogen. Und dafür ist so wenig passiert.
Mal ganz davon abgesehen, dass fast alle Charaktere, vor allem die Hauptermittlerin, absolut unsympathisch sind."
"Long book. Why? Every possible scenario was dissected repeatedly and of course it was wrong. I was to the point of ""I don't care!"" Just tell me. Now! I don't remember feeling this way about TF's other books."
"This book was like watching the same first half hour of a Law & Order episode…..
20 times in a row! Woman is killed, police pin it on boyfriend with no real evidence. So, they now throw in a best friend, an imaginary ex boyfriend, a stalker, and a mob captain into the mix. Go over all the details of the murder each time, with no real evidence again!! Way too long, repetitive, and boring. Throw in endless petty police infighting to top it off. Skip it!"
Pfff con lo que me gustó En piel ajena... siento que este me ha llamado 0 la atención. Tiene sus giros pero en general no me han caído bien ni los personajes ni me ha atraído el caso así que... bastante fría:(
"That was a lot of writing with not much happening! Not what I expected from her. Enjoyed all of her other books except this one.
"
Too much charachter development for characters that don't matter. Took forever for something to happen. Side story about her father was extraneous. Good ending.
"This book was OK, but not good enough that I'd recommend it to friends. If the book were shorter, perhaps I would, but definitely not for the length it is. "
"I usually devour French's books but this one was difficult to get through. There was never any ""hook"" to keep me going and I just finished it to finish it. :("
I have loved other books by Tana French but really struggled with this one. The plot really dragged for me and I had to force myself to finish it. 
Really boring. 
"For a police procedural, this book spends a lot of time spinning theories instead of following the facts. "
I hate that I'm a martyr for books. 
way too long for a plot so small in substance
"Good for reading on a beach, absolutely nothing else."
I was very disappointed. I loved all of her other books. The main character was completely unlikable. Didn't even try to finish it.
The first half of this dragged so badly I set it down and read another book. I decided to give it a second chance and it does pick up a little and get interesting but it's still a slow read. 
I have read several of her books and found them hard to put down. This one was hard to pick up. The story was not that intriguing and the book ran on too long. A big huge meh.
Very long winded book.
"Didn't like nearly as well as her book, Secret Places. She really does a fine job in character study, but there wasn't enough action, twists and turns to be satisfying for this particular genre."
I've loved or really liked every other book in this series but I really struggled with this one. I didn't engage with Antoinette at all and I found the story very predictable. 
Second book of hers that was extremely boring and slow paced. I always finish a book but I found myself just skimming the pages. Not sure if I'll continue with Tanya French's novels. 
"A word to the author, a little paranoia goes a long way. This was a bit tedious to slog through. "
"Love Tana French...hated this book. The plot doesn't make sense, the inner monologue of the main character is beyond boring and annoying. Not much of a mystery either. Skip this one!"
I had a hard time getting into this one. I stopped reading after chapter two.
still good but just got bogged down i think i dind't like a or didn't undrstand her might try to read again
Unnecessarily long and tedious.
"I tried very hard to like this novel, but the narrator and the pace of the story just did me in. "
This was a disappointment. I didn't enjoy all the main character's angst.
Honestly was about 150 pages TOOOOOOOOOO LOOOOOOOOOOONG
I really wanted to like this book but I just couldn't enjoy it. I felt the story dragged and most of the characters were very unlikable. I finished because I wanted to find out who the killer was. 
"Not my favorite of hers, kind of had to force myself to finish this one. "
This story is so slow that I lost interest in it after having read about 25%. Very disappointing.
Not my cup of tea. More review later!
Meh - main character rather irritating. But I found the victim interesting and so I read it through.
such a disappointment
"Could have cut almost half the book, and with all that bulk it still never earned my attention. "
I was disappointed with this book. Too tedious!
"I started listening to the audio. I stopped because of the frequent use of the f word and other swear words. So, it may be a good book."
"I typically love Tana French, but this was disappointing. Mostly police procedural; lots of talking and not much action. "
I do not know why I plowed thru this book?
"Too long and slow.

This is my second book in the series & will be my last. I don’t understand some of the slang. Almost didn’t stick with it."
Slow and boring. Don't think I'll read any more of this series...
This book seemed to drag on and on without much happening. I'm still scratching my head over the ending because I have no idea what it meant! 
First 75% was slow and the detail was uninteresting. Last 25% was enjoyable beach reading. Was never gripped or guessing.
Meh. Really tailed off. I lost interest but slogged through.
Audiobook. Passed the time.
"Starts out slow, very little suspense, kind of tedious and took forever getting to the point."
Lost interest 1/3 of the way through. Have enjoyed her other books much more.
This book is intriguing but REALLY drawn out.
Irish author
this novel kept on chasing its tail and it fell flat in the end. disappointed.
"It ain't no ""In The Woods."" Hell, it ain't ""The Secret Place,"" and French set that one at Hogwarts."
"If you can get through the first 3/4 of the book, the ending is good, but for that first part of the book it is so very slow and frustrating!"
Monotonous and slow - filler and fluff.
Not up to French's usual standard. Too much time spent in protagonist's disgruntled head and mystery itself was not engaging. Slow read.
"Unfortunately and sadly, this will be my last book by Tana French. It was at least 100 pages too long, too much narrative, too many words. The story line was good, but lost in all those words."
Nebylo to spatne. Jen hooooodne pomaly rozjezd. 
good page turning for when you are suck in bed recovering from surgery
The book was hard to get through. 
Definitely an engaging read; this one just lacked something in comparison to French's other books I've read. 
"I couldn't get thru it. Nothing captivated me. Horrible language. Too much police dialogue, which necessarily isn't bad, but can get boring. Didn't finish the book...."
"Much, much longer than it needed to be"
"Felt like it went on way too long. By the time the ""shocker"" came out I wasn't even very interested in the book any more. "
Had to finish it to see who did it. Won't be going back to read others in the series. Way too much detail. For a 450 page paperback she could cut out at least 100 pages.
I have to say this wasn’t my favorite of Tana French’s books. It was a really long book with a really simple story. The plot was slow moving and all they did was talk. Very boring. 
"Lectura aburrida, repetitiva, una historia que nunca me enganchó, al final la autora trató de mejorarla pero sin mayor éxito. "
Too too slow paced! First book that I’ve read by her. May I should read another.
too wordy and long
"It shoulduld have been shorter. To many ""what if"" conversations between the two main characters."
The book started off great but the story seemed to drag on and on and on. 
I thought this book was fairly predictable & incorporated a ton of stereotypes. I’ve read much better mysteries lately.
Long drawn out chapters that were hard to finish!! I skipped ahead many times and never did get to like or care about any of these characters! 
"I kept Waiting for it to get good....

Usually I really like Tana French. This one was tedious - dragged on and on - and was too predictable and tidy."
"This just didn't have the same feel as other Tana French books. Compared to my favorites: The Likeness and The Secret Place, this was stagnant and without the mystery that normally pulls me in."
"my least favorite by this author. maybe its bc i don't care about cop dynamics, or the murder itself never got interesting enough to make up for the rest of the tedium. "
I've read many if her books&-- not her best
"2.5 to 3. The Tresspasser was, like all of the Murder Squad books, meticulously written, but in the case of this installment, was the issue. Mainly I was bored and it ran way too long. "
Was not my favorite book this was about the corrupt cops
Could not finish this
2.5
"slow, dead ends drawn out and unconvincing. "
So slow. Nothing happens. Had to force myself to keep reading. So many words and nothing really happens. 
I just can’t. Superfluous. Soooo long. Stopped reading every page 
This a terrible book
"I thought this was too slow, and how the detectives created a theory was a bit absurd. It's okay."
The story just drags on & on & on .... all about the detectives personal lives. I didn’t care. At pg 183 I pitched it to the dustbin. 
"I usually really like Tana French, this one missed the Mark for me. "
"Мне было очень скучно и вообще, я как та мышка, которая кололась, но ела кактус. Надо уже забыть про эту писательницу и принять, что ну не моё совершенно. "
Good mystery set in Dublin but too long-500 pages-
It’s a bit of a tedious reading since it goes into full length of detective procedures and I was annoyed with the main character but the ending made me not hate the book 
Meh!
Took so long to finish it. It was so boring and I should’ve dnfed it!!
"It started off boring, proceeded to ""meh"", and ended like ""fwap""."
"DNF 60%. slow and mundane. shame, but it seems for me ""..Woods"" was a fluke."
Many twists and a bit to much psychological thinking for me.
Very slow moving. I struggled to finish the book which was unusual because others by Ms. French were very enjoyable. Not sure what happened with this one.
I couldn’t stand the protagonist. 
"This book just went on and on and on. And nothing really captivated me. Too many words with a thin plot. I should’ve abandoned the book, but I have a hard time doing that. Not French’s best work. "
Tana French can be quite the windbag. Could have been at least 100 pages shorter. 
"Couldn't finish this one. Very slow, very boring, and lacking French's more literary qualities."
"I only picked this up because it was my local library’s book club pick. It was horrible. I hated all the characters, there was too much talking by everyone and absolutely no action."
My least favorite of all Tana French’s books. Was super slow. The first 60%was more or less character development. The ending was good- just took a long time to get there 
Too long. Too slow. Antoinette was too paranoid and self-consciously hard. Disappointing. 
This was an audiobook I started for a bookclub but I was a little lost and didn't enjoy the narrator so I might try starting at the beginning of the series in print.
Too long.
"This book dragged on far too long. In fact, I skipped 150 pages somewhere in the middle to reach the last 100 pages, and I didn’t miss any details that I needed. "
im so sorry tana french I still love u tho
2.75
"Typically, this is not my genre to be fair. I really liked Tana's style and voice but I didn't like the main character or the pace, so DNF for me. "
Too slooooow
"3/10
I see nice elements, but too realistic for me, focused on daily police life. I could not stand the narrator complaining about her job anymore after half the book."
DNF—I love Tana but this one and the 5th Dublin Murder squad book were just soooo boring I couldn’t finish either😭
"Too many words. I found myself skipping anything that wasn’t dialogue. Good story, but.. nah. "
Looking back at the summary I could not remember anything about this book. 
Way too long and verbose without a ton of substance to the plot. 
I just couldn’t get into the characters so only read half of the book.
I normally like Tana French's novels but this one annoyed me the entire way through. Antoinette is too whiny and paranoid and the rest of the story gets lost.
"DNF. The book was slow going anyway, not particularly engaging, and when I came to the line ""Sweet Jesus jumping on a pogo stick"", I said, that's enough, and quit reading altogether.... "
"Finished out of spite. More of a me problem though because I don’t like procedurals, I don’t know why I picked this one up. "
The book took too long to make a point. Would have enjoyed it if this book was 200 pgs less. 
Too much detail. 
"I really tried, couldn't get through it. I read The Searcher by Tana French and liked it a lot, but this book felt very tedious. I kept going back to it, but ultimately couldn't finish it."
this book took until 70% of the way in to get interesting. i can’t believe i persisted (and what was the point of having her dad show up for 3 pages in the middle of the book?) 
This one didn’t do it for me. Should gave been 100 pages shorter. 
im not finishing this book it’s too slow for me
"I would die for Tana French but not my favorite. Not a very compelling protagonist, and the relationships feel forced. Not that interested in the ending, either. "
this took me sooo long to get through because it got so boring. i finished it out of spite tbh but overall it was alright. like a 5/10
Did not finish. Slow with no action. Too much dialogue. Unlikeable main character
definitely one of my least favorite of french’s. antoinette was extremely unlikable and the book could’ve been 100 pages shorter.
ending finally came. was OK. leading up to took forever 
Had to push myself to finish this one.
"Nice first draft.

Now narrow it down to just one story, cut out half the characters, and give us a real ending worth reading for.

But for God’s sake don’t monkey with that hardshell persona and kick-ass writing style."
"While I did enjoy this book, I thought it could have been condensed to fewer pages each chapter. "
"Someone please tell me why this book is highly rated? The language alone put me off, forget the plot. My first book by Tana French, and I had high expectations, but they fell pretty flat."
This book took too long to grab my interest. Things starting speeding up after the half way mark. A good detective thriller should grab your attention much earlier. 
"Not really finding the mystery within the mystery novel, and not enjoying her characters as much as her previous books. Meh."
"I really wanted to like this more than I did! So far the only other Tana French book I've read is Broken Harbor, and I enjoyed that, but this book mainly just irritated me. The good: I was genuinely intrigued by the victim's story and background, and the interrogation scenes were all excellent.

Antoinette frustrated me, because she was so damn unlikable. Even with the terrible treatment she had to put up with from most of her fellow detectives, I found it difficult to have any sympathy for her--she had negative (and sometimes hateful) thoughts about every single person she encountered.

A major plot point drove me crazy: 
Why was Aislinn's father able to run off and start a new life when he had a young child? Does Ireland not have child support obligations? As we learned, it's not like no one could find him... multiple detectives were aware he'd been located, and his missing person's case was ""closed"". Really? I can see not telling his wife, but I'm pretty sure you can't just abandon one family and start a new one without financially supporting your kid."
"Very slow read for me, maybe partly due to not having read books 1 - 5?"
"A crime procedural with heavy doses of sarcasm, suspicion, crassness and cruelty from the protagonist."
"I had to struggle with this book. There were too many times when I was frustrated with the characters. The story had a number of twists and turns but I found myself not liking the characters and too much of the time the ruminations within Conway's mind were like being inside a circle without knowing why.
For a procedural, I felt as if I were there as these detectives wrote each report, dotted each 'I' and crossed each 't"". I was ready for the story to end about half-way through the pages."
"The main character annoys me. I kept waiting for a moment where she realized maybe the world wasn’t against her, but it sort of was and then she still only sort of got that it wasn’t all about her. Interesting enough that I finished but I wouldn’t recommend. "
Didn't get remotely interesting until page 100 and it took until page 300 for it to get somewhat good. The main character (and many others) is a jerk. Just couldn't enjoy this book overall.
"Not terrible, but lacked suspense and intrigue. I lost interest about halfway through, and the second half just dragged to a conclusion that we pretty much saw coming. I think it could have been a better story with 100 less pages. "
This was a difficult read for me. It just didn't grip me like other Tana French books. 
I've loved all 0f Tana French's books. Not this one. Not at all. Dragged on and on and on and on. The main detective is a miserable witch. The only likeable character in the book is her partner but she throws shade on him so much and makes you wonder if he is legit or a traitor. 2 stars is generous. 
"As a fan of Tana French, I was incredibly disappointed in this one. Wafer thin, uninteresting central plot and a flat, annoying central character, and execution that felt half-hearted. She, like all of us, are entitled to a bad run. So, hoping this is it and we are back on form. "

Plot Teaser
Antoinette Conway is a tough female detective in Dublin’s murder squad who is struggling to gain the respect of her squad team members. When Antoinette and her partner Steve are assigned to a case which looks like the run-of-the-mill domestic violence fare that they’re typically assigned to, they soon realize there may actually be more to this case than meets the eye. Antoinette embarks on a quest to discover who can be trusted, including whether she can trust her own instincts.

What I Liked
The plot. This is a solid murder mystery with a relatively complex plot that involves violence, deceit, potential stalking, interrogations and psychological games. The ending of the novel was surprising enough to make me feel like, despite my distaste for the writing and characters, reading it was not a complete waste of time. If you don’t mind crude language and a very negative protagonist, I think you’ll find The Trespasser provides decent thrills and twists. It has a plethora of 5 star reviews on Goodreads, so there are clearly those who appreciate French’s style of writing enough that it doesn’t stop them from enjoying the plot of the book itself.

What I Didn’t Like
The writing. I had never read Tana French before so I came to The Trespasser unprepared for the amount of slang and curse words that she includes in her dialogue and in her protagonist’s internal thoughts. The book is narrated from the point of view of Antoinette Conway, and I think that French went overboard in trying to make Conway seem tough and like one of the guys through peppering her speech and thoughts with way too many expletives. The amount of cursing didn’t seem realistic, and it quickly made the writing sound repetitive because French relies on the same 5 or 6 curse words throughout the novel. Based on the writing, I think I will be avoiding novels by Tana French in the future.

The protagonist. I didn’t like detective Antoinette Conway from the beginning and I found her characterization to be one-dimensional and overdone. French portrays her as a paranoid, aggressive woman who thinks every single person she encounters is somehow out to get her. There was no nuance to her character and she was a terrible person to everyone around her because of her defensiveness and tendency to second guess everyone else’s intentions. French tries to give Antoinette a backstory that will serve to partly justify her extreme personality, but even the backstory seems just thrown in as an afterthought to try to unsuccessfully add depth to Conway’s character.

The length. This book was 464 pages, and I would say at least 164 of them were superfluous. In some parts of the book, I found myself skimming paragraphs and I realized that even doing so, I wasn’t missing any of the action. In a tightly-woven thriller that is supposed to provide intricate clues at every turn, it’s not a good sign that you can skim over page after page and still be completely clued in. French goes way overboard in the time she dedicates to detailing Detective Conway’s ruminations after each suspect’s statement in an interrogation or after each phrase Antoinette speaks in a squad meeting. Did it mean this? Did it mean that? Could it be interpreted other ways? After pages and pages of this, I must confess I no longer cared to know. The novel would have been much more enjoyable as a fast-paced thriller if it had actually been fast-paced.

Final Verdict
The decent plot did not make up for the shoddy writing, crude language and the slow pace for me. With many excellent reviews on Goodreads, however, if you’re already a fan of French’s writing you may still want to give it a shot."
"I loved the plot line before I read it. The book is roughly 450 pages, it easily could have been 300 pages and been done. Way too drawn out. "
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
"It's a well-written book that I found extremely boring and waaaaay too long. The main characters are completely unlikable, which made me side with the bad guys till the end.

MEH."
Not my favorite Tana French novel. It's slow and boring compared to the others.
"So. Much. Dialogue.

Having enjoyed many of Tana French's previous ""Dublin Murder Squad"" novels, I was looking forward to reading this one. Now that I'm through it, can't say this one will be one of my favorites.

Comprised primarily of monologues and dialogues, this story contains almost no action beyond walking from one place to another while thinking/talking, sitting around thinking/talking, driving while thinking/talking, eating while thinking/talking...you get the picture.

While some readers may see this as a fascinating look into the minds of detectives as they struggle to solve a murder, I found it to be a direct rebellion against the old writer's rule of ""show, don't tell."" There's a lot of telling in this book. A lot."
"The Dublin murder pair - a simple murder of a young girl. They spend all their time trying to blame it on Rory- a new boyfriend. The best girlfriend finally gives up the real story- it was a cop who she was having an affair with. It was really draggy - I got tired of all the suppositions, with nothing to back it up. (same Dublin cops Antoinette and Steve-)"
Was way too long. Scenes in the interview/interrogation room was too drawn out for me.
2.5 weak. 
"Jag har varit ett stort fan av The Dublin Murder Squad-serien, inte minst för språkets skull, men här har Tana French övergjort det med snärtiga dialoger och otaliga vändningar. Det kan bli för mycket av det goda. "
"I've really enjoyed all the other Tana French books I've read (and I think I've read them all now) but I had a hard time adjusting to this character's point of view. I have no idea why - but something about the way it was written was more difficult for me to get into.

Now, several weeks after I've finished the book, I really can't even remember much about the plot other than a lot of details were about internal police affairs. There must have been some murder or something but I have retained none of it. Maybe that's why I couldn't get into this book. I liked it enough to finish reading it, but the murder mystery part - typically the highlight of her books for me - just got buried under the internal affairs angle."
"First of all, I could listen to someone with an Irish accent read the phone book (ditto Neil Gaiman) so I bought this Tana French book when I saw it on sale on Audible. As much as I like the accent though, I was sorely tempted to move to the next book on my list about half way through. There is very, very little plot and virtually no action. The book consists almost entirely of the two murder detectives coming up with ""What if"" scenarios to explain the murder of a young woman in Dublin. Even the characters themselves mention how tired the are of the what ifs. We see the story almost entirely from the perspective of Detective Antoinette Conway. Detective Conway has a huge chip on her shoulder which quickly gets tiresome. There is virtually no tension of any sort until Chapter 15 of 19. Even that though is done by a long interview between the cops and the suspect. Police procedurals should have red herrings, car chases, flashing lights, wailing sirens etc. This one was just boring"
Not my favorite. Seemed long and drawn out. Did not read the first 5 (this is #6 of the Dublin Murder Squad Series).
"This is a marked improvement from the previous entry to the Dublin Murder Squad series, that's for sure. The Secret Place was really terrible, boring, unconvincing and painfully overcooked.

Continuing the trend, here we have the first person narration coming from a supporting character in that previous book. And this is part of the problem. Conway is painfully dull and unlikeable. Monomaniacally convinced the world is out to get her but she's too proud to let them win, she continually caused me to roll my eyes and mutter ""oh for heavens sakes"".

Another part of the problem is the jacket copy. Talking of the murder Conway and Moran will investigate, it says ""Uniforms call it in as a slam-dunk domestic. Except when Conway takes a good look at the victim's face, she realises she's seen her somewhere before. And she knows there's a different answer. And it takes her breath away."" Yeah, that sounds exciting, but that isn't really what happens. It takes about a third of the book before the realisation occurs and when it does, it then doesn't lead anywhere or add any excitement or tension to the novel for AGES. French has Conway plod us through many lengthy and uninteresting dead ends and diversions before arriving at the destination which has been obvious for quite some time. And when we get there, none of it rings true. The victim and the perpetrator both become painfully two dimensional and entirely impossible to believe in by the time French is done.

The biggest part of the problem is the writing. With Secret Place, French seemed to decide she was James Joyce or something, and subjected us to some really terrible prose. This continues here, as Conway loves to wax lyrical, at length, about nothing much at all. The book is FULL of stuff like this:

""When he left the room, he took something with him, some dark savage charge sizzling the air. Without him at its heart, the room’s gone flat and sickly and stupid. ""

and that makes it such a chore to slog through. At one point, Conway spends nearly a full page listing all the different ways they crank up the tension in suspect interviews. The point is made by example three, but don't worry, there are another thirty to come in case you didn't quite get it. And it means nothing, adds nothing and goes nowhere.

With a ruthless editor, this could have been 100 pages shorter, breathlessly paced and really exciting. As it is, it's too long and packed far too full of ludicrous prose to do more than raise a shrug."
"I listened to the audiobook of The Trespasser and though I enjoyed the narrator's various accents as a matter of curiosity, I think I probably would have liked the book more if I had read it and hadn't been focused so much on deciphering the words and infering meaning. It felt like every other word was ""gaf/gaffer"" or ""kip.""

Putting all the interesting accent and dialect stuff aside, the plot of this book was not at all ""thrilling"" and didn't even feel very mysterious to me. The culprit seemed pretty obvious from fairly early on, and not all that interesting anyway. The whole thing had way too much painful self analysis and inter-office politics and didn't even feel like a detective story so much as one of those introspective 'journey of self discovery' type reads. On top of that, the main character struck me as incredibly obnoxious. She's hyper-judgmental of everyone around her, mainly for characteristics she considers whiny or soft, but her thoughts and internal dialogue are nothing but whiny self-pitying drivel. Maybe this was supposed to be one of the big 'conflicts' of this book, but it was too irritating to be interesting.

I didn't hate the book nearly as much as my review makes it sound. I genuinely thought ""it was ok"" and that's what 2 stars means. I think I'm being a little heavy on the criticism here because I am so shocked that the reviews are unfailingly positive. Normally when I disagree with the majority I can see why: there's some specific pet peeve of mine that I know doesn't bother others, or even if I don't like a book I can still see how it was well written or had a unique chain of events or ending or what have you. In this case, it's not like the book was bad even, it just wasn't great. Nothing about it stands out to me as unusual or excellent or even above average, so what's with all the terrific reviews? I feel like I must have been listening to a different book, I mean even the title doesn't make a lot of sense! 
Nobody in the book even 'trespasses', so who is the title even referring to! The main character's estranged father sort of stalks her, but is actually forced into her home the one time he's there. The murderer was in a long term relationship with the victim and had a key he used the night he killed her!

Anyway, I'm not abandoning Tana French yet, I've already started listening to the first book in this seriesIn the Woods and am really enjoying it."
"In preparation for watching the Super Bowl, my spouse purchased a giant bag of potato chips. He didn't tell me he'd gotten them until he was heading to his friend's house to watch the game because he loves me and he knows I have absolutely no self-control when it comes to potato chips. Once the bag is open, I'm seduced by the grease and the crunch and even though they tear up my mouth and make my stomach feel miserable, I keep eating them until the entire bag of kettle-cooked sin is empty. They're tasty, but not tasty enough to keep me from regretting the potato-chip hangover.

This is kind of how I felt reading this novel. It was a tasty read, but not tasty enough to justify my compulsion to shove aside my morning tasks to finish the novel. The plot got bogged down by routine: the constant driving back and forth across Dublin, talking and re-talking to witnesses. The ""initial here and sign there"" statement-taking might be realistic, but it certainly wasn't scintillating reading. Moran and Conway's motivations were dilute and their thought processes convoluted, and then there was a plot twist with a walk-on character that French seems to have added to serve a relationship-building purpose but that didn't fit the rest of the book. French usually does pretty well with her characters, but these seemed to be walking, talking paper dolls. And she used the word ""tattoo"" in the sense of ""tapping a tattoo on the corner of the desk,"" which makes me roll my eyes hard enough to cause injury. People mostly seem to use that word just to appear clever, and that annoys the crap out of me.

But like with the potato chips, even with all of the things that annoyed me about this novel, even knowing that I was going to regret phoning in my morning responsibilities and the headache that the afternoon would surely hold as a result, I kept reading.

After I finish gorging myself on potato chips, I eat loads of salad and drink gallons of water and after twelve hours or so, I feel pretty much back to normal with only a slight aftertaste of self-loathing for once again doing exactly what I shouldn't do. Now that I've crunched my way through The Trespasser, I'm going to have to find the literary equivalent of salad and water."
"I have read the other reviews and I must say I appear alone in my assessment of this book. Admittedly I have only read the first two books by French. I tried the third and could not get through it. After reading the NYT review I thought I would give her another go and I was just annoyed and maddened all throughout the reading. It's a testament to her writing that I even kept at it. It is slow, ponderous and needs to be tightened up for flow. However, my biggest complaint is the main character. All her bitching and griping about the victim being this or that and completely ignoring her own bitching and griping about her lot in the murder room. Yes, she has had to endure discrimination and she has marginally justified anger issues but I got tired quickly listening to her whine. I wanted to slap her upside the head and tell her to get over it and either deal with it or leave. Her bitterness and isolation and the belief that everybody is out to get her got tiresome. I have no wish to revisit her character so Tana French is off my reading list. I did give it two stars because Ms. French can write and she has a lovely turn of phrase. "
"With each successive book I read by this author, the less I seem to enjoy it. While I haven't read all of the Dublin Murder series, this makes the third one I've read and I'm going to give it fewer stars than either of the others. To me it was simply a tarted up police procedural led by a main character filled with self doubt. Similar to my review of a previous Tana French novel, there was repetition in the telling and some excruciatingly long periods of text where the writing spiraled inwards instead of providing more for the reader. I felt that the book could have been a hundred pages shorter. I realize that there are many 4 and 5 star ratings so clearly I'm the outlier, but to me, the hype was greater than the delivery."
I was excited to dive into a Tara Finch novel having heard such good things about her writing. Unfortunately I did not find this book engaging. It was filled with many details that were irrelevant to the main story line. The main character had a chip on her shoulder and her drama got old. The end of the novel was great! 
My god was this a slow read. My least favorite so far of all the Tana French books. 
 I was super excited to read this. Like super stoked when I saw it was out. But it took me more than a month to actually read it. I tried in November and couldn't get into it. I picked it back up in early January and just finished it today. I swear that my stubbornness was the only reason I finished it. I feel like there was a lot of boring and repetitive fillers that took away from the few things I enjoyed about the book. 
2.5 stars. My least favorite Tana French :(
"While I really like French's writing style, this was a...frustrating book. The overall story isn't bad (which saves it from being a one-star book), but I really got tired of the main character, Conway. For almost the whole book, she's so completely and utterly focused on how everyone is out to get her that it took her past the point of sympathetic to just irritating. I'm sure that there are unfortunately still too many places with the ""boys club, no girls allowed"" mentality. But in this book, Conway cannot see outside of that box and so sees *everything* at her job as having no other even remotely possible motive. When the book is written entirely in first person from her perspective, this single-minded obsession - and essentially martyr complex - wears out very early on. I wanted to smack her upside the head and tell her, ""It's not all about you! You are not the center of everyone's universe, and people do actually do things *without* it being all about you!"" I'm fine with a flawed main character, but this was beyond flawed and became just very unsympathetic and irritating. It also doesn't help that, because she's so completely consumed with the ""everyone's out to get me"" mentality, she cannot (except for one brief moment near the end) step out of herself to understand *anyone* else, especially her murder victim."
"I didn't realize that this was the 6th book in the ""Dublin Murder Squad"" series by Tana French. Oops. Perhaps I would've liked it more had I read the five books that lead up to this one. I found the main character in this book (Antoinette) to be quite unlikeable, and at times her unlikeability made her seem like a poorly constructed character. As this story takes place in Dublin, there were also some word choices and phrasing that were foreign to me though could be completely accurate of the location. Anyway, the story is pretty lame and drawn out for a book that's 400 pages: two rookie detectives (or Ds as they're called throughout the book) on the Dublin Murder Squad are given a case of Aislinn Murray, girl murdered in her home, and their strongest lead is a guy she just started seeing who was coming over for dinner that night (Rory Fallon). Nothing really pans out there. Aislinn's best friend Lucy lets on that Aislinn had a secret boyfriend. He turns out to be a cop- one on the Murder Squad- and his partner has been leading Antoinette and her partner down paths to steer them off course and away from involving his partner. Somehow it all comes out who it is, and he confesses to what he's done. I thought there would be some twist or something, but it was pretty straight-forward. Not wowed by it. "
"I hate to say it, but I didn't really like this novel. I LOVED Tana French's first four books; they were all terrific. The 5th one, ""A Secret Place"", I liked but not as much, and ""The Trespasser"", just didn't hold my attention as the other ones did, unfortunately. The story dragged a bit and I didn't like the characters. They were not how I remembered them from the previous books. Overall, I think it's still an interesting mystery, if you haven't read Tana French's books, but I would recommend her first four much more highly, especially ""In the Woods"" and ""The Likeness""."
"Hmmmm. I normally love Tana French and the members of the DMS. But I didn't exactly love 'Broken Harbor' and 'The Trespasser' did nothing for me.

It could just be me but I think it's the protagonist Antoinette Conway. It's not that's she unlikable. I mean I'm a fan of unlikable women characters and not just today's popular ones, a la in novels like 'Gone Girl' or 'Woman in a Train.' Olive Kitteridge in Strout's short stories series of the same name? Nora is Eldridge in Messud's 'The Woman Upstairs'? Mathilde in 'Fates and Furies'? Bernadette in Semple's 'Where'd You Go, Bernadette'? Barbara in Heller's 'What was She Thinking? Notes on a Scandal'? They were wicked and I loved them! The difference is those characters were interesting to me, in part because the authors revealed there was often a method to their madness, a compelling story behind their wickedness, their rejection of convention and willingness to do harm (they were clearly in the wrong but by the end of the novel, you understood them even as you condemned everything they did). Conway wasn't an interesting character. There was a backstory theoretically explaining why Conway was the way she was, but it wasn't particularly interesting. Sigh."
"The mystery here was not very mysterious and the narrator was too self-involved to be likable. She continually creates problems for herself with how she treats those around her and then whines about why no one likes her. And I could see from early on where the story was headed, and was disappointed not to be surprised. Overall this was not nearly as good as the previous books in the series. "
"Tana French is a favorite of mine, but this is my least favorite of her mysteries. I admit that I was going through a difficult time personally as I was reading it, and I really craved an engrossing mystery to serve as distraction. This mystery was not very intriguing to start with, and then it unfolded at snails' pace. I enjoyed her characters, as always, but the suspense was lacking. "
"I normally don't review my ""guilty pleasures,"" but I have 'em just like anyone else, and during the past year, recovering from surgery, I've tried dozens of books and authors I wouldn't normally give a second glance.

Ms. French is a clever writer who puts most of her effort into Irish urban slang and nonstop dialog, both outer and inner, both of which become tedious in the extreme. What she doesn't seem to care much about is setting, ambiance, or character development. I'm aware that Irish cities tend to be pretty dismal places, so maybe her failure to evoke them is a blessing in disguise! But her protagonist could do with a life - Detective Conway has got to be one of the most boring, selfish, one-dimensional characters I've ever encountered. She has no style, no passions or interests other than the case she's working on, and even that seems to be more of a nuisance or an annoyance than a passion. She despises nature and spends almost all her time in a state of anger or paranoia. Let's hope she doesn't become the subject of a series…."
"Such a disappointment! Tana French really let me down on this one.

Dublin sounds like a dark, dirty, awful city (which it is not), and the Murder Squad for which Antoinette Conway works is a good-ole-boys organization where women are not only ostracized for being women, but are also the butt of mean comments, practical jokes, and questionable practices. And that is what this book seems to dwell on ad-nauseum.

Conway and her partner, Steve Moran, are investigating the murder of a young woman. There is very little action; most of the book shares with the reader the theories and discussions between various murder detectives regarding the case. The story is far more passive than active, and written in first person, filled with Irish colloquialisms, slang, and the callous attitude of Conway.

It took me a long time to read this 460 page book, not because of the number of pages, but because I couldn't keep my mind from wandering, and because I kept finding things to do other than read.


"
"Boy, I sure hope this isn't the way most police departments conduct themselves in an investigation. It seems they spend more energy trying to outfox each other, and not enough on actually solving crimes; not a very productive work environment. I would like to believe that smart people know how to conduct themselves at work. This leads me to the conclusion that French's characters are not smart. Nor are they likeable (other than Steve of course - he's lovely).

Why are the characters (including the main character) in French's novels so unpleasant and do they have to talk so much? Talk, talk, talk, talk...Sure, the dialogue can be ""cracking"", because that's what French is so good at: good cracking dialogue. She's a showoff. She's a dialogue hot dog. Most of it is just ""bollocks"" though. Or is it bolliks?

Edit: I'm at page 410, and I can't go on. There are 449 pages in the book. I don't even care what happens."
"This had so much potential! A wonderful author voice, great writing, amazing turns of phrase. But by God, it was so incredibly tedious! Pages upon pages, chapters upon chapters, of absolutely NOTHING happening. For a mystery / thriller, this is one of the most boring books I’ve ever come across. I had such a hard time reading this before bed, because it would put me to sleep every time. I never quite warmed up to Antoinette - I found her way too prickly and defensive, perhaps for good reason but it still made her quite unlikeable. And so since I wasn’t really rooting for her, nor for anyone else, it made for very uninteresting reading. I hung in there and made it to the end, but I can’t say I’m happy to have read it. I’ve heard so many great things about Tana French, and I’m willing to try something else by her at a later date, but THE TRESPASSER was probably not the best introduction to her work."
I wish I'd liked the main character better. Or found the mystery to be shown and not told (through her rather insufferable voice.) 
"Strictly by the numbers police procedural. And I'm not even sure I'll finish it. I'm on p. 171, and I can't for the life of me remember the narrator's name.

Not only that, aside from the male pranking, I don't even ""get"" that she's a woman. I mean, there is not that much in her inner monologue to distinguish her from the protagonist of the book I just finished reading, Mick ""Scorcher"" Kennedy.

So far, the case is nothing but a couple of fantasies: mousy girl who's been put in a corner all her life starts to bloom. A mousy guy falls for her. Immediately, he becomes the no. 1 suspect in her murder. Not only that, on the basis of a girlfriend's info, they assume the victim was seeing another guy on the side. On the basis of the victim having books on crime and gangs in her apartment, the ""other guy"" (who so far, I'm not even sure really exists. Except in the detectives' minds) must have been a gangster. Have you SEEN my bookshelves at home?"
"This book was 200 pages too long. It started out better than #5, but it just kept circling back and trying to hard to make up stories that were so improbable that it seemed like the main characters were kids playing cops and robbers instead of supposedly trained detectives trying to solve a case. The way their brains spun off it was ridiculous. Also, from the very beginning the crudeness and language just seemed to forced. I normally do not have a problem with profanity in books, but this and the insults were so over the top and unnecessary it took away from the flow of the writing.

I started off loving the Dublin Murder Squad series, but after the last two, I might be done. After about 40% of this book, I just wanted it to be over, and barely had the patience to get through all the theories she was trying to spin before coming down with a real suspect. Sigh. Bummer."
"I'm so happy to have finished this book. It was really a slog for me to get through it and I only got made it through the last 100 pages by fortifying myself with coffee and Christmas cookies. I'm a big fan of French and I like how her books focus more on the detectives working the case rather than on the murderer or the victim. But I found the main detective in this one, Antoinette Conway, to be really annoying and it was hard for me to be sympathetic to page after page of her whining about how none of the other detectives like her. I also thought this book needed a better editor, the beginning moved so slowly and there was a lot of repetitive conversations that could have been cut out. I still think French is a talented writer and I would read future books by her, I just can't recommend this one. "
"I started reading Tana French with The Likeness and I was hooked. From there I read all the others, but none were quite as good as The Likeness. They were all good, but none gave me the thrill that Likeness did. Even so, I eagerly awaited The Tresspasser, and then eagerly waited for my library copy. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed with The Tresspasser. :( It took forever to get going and didn't really get interesting until the final 10 pages or so. I got really tired of the main character's whining and bad attitude. She was such a miserable person. I never thought about this book when I wasn't reading it, and it took forever to get through. I really didn't like it. I feel so bad saying that because I really enjoyed the others and loved The Likeness. But this one really didn't do it for me."
"This was my first experience reading Tana French and my negative reaction to it is attributable to a mistake on my part. Had I been introduced to the character of Antoinette earlier in her books, I might have found her sympathetic. However, this was a pick up from a local bookshop after reading the blurb so I found the descriptions of police procedural rather tedious. I enjoyed her writing but think this book probably didn't make for a very good stand-alone read. The mystery was interesting enough in its way but the paranoia exhibited by Detective Conway grated on my nerves. My favourite part was when a certain arrogant character got his comeuppance from an unexpected ally but I disliked the brow beating of the primary suspect in the murder mystery. I was coming in expecting a psychological thriller so I was disappointed despite the motivations of the murder victim.

"
"Maybe I'm not in the mood for a mystery but I quit one third of the way through. Bored with the narrative. It could have been done in half the time spent. Don't care about the characters. Tired of the Irish swearing. I get it, they're Irish. "
I am a big fan of Tana French. Her best novels are Into the Woods and The Likeness. She is an Irish writer and her novels take place in Ireland so one needs to remember that the setting and characters are Irish. The Trespasser is an interesting detective novel; not as mesmerizing as some of her others but it has that psychological edge to it as do all of hers. Her novels loosely follow each other as they feature different characters from the older stories. Tana French has a talent for character development. Her characters are complex; with flaws and strengths. She makes it so easy to get to know each one and feel their emotions. The plot is also complex and has many twists. If you haven't read her earlier work - do so - you won't be disappointed!
This book was greatly anticipated by me. I have read all of Tana French's other works and have loved them. I read a quarter of this book and returned it. It has been a long time since I was so disappointed in a book. The theme of the put upon female detective is so ten years ago and the author can't get past it. Everything relates to her being a female in a male dominated profession. Get over it!!! Get on with the story which is also very slow in developing to the point that it was annoying rather than interesting. Maybe because I was looking forward to another Tana French original that this was so disappointing.
"First this is not a bad book at all but it is a long book. French is a good writer so even though I always consider not reading her books, I end up reading it. The Trespasser is no exception. This is definitely a study in psychology and what motivates people to do the things they do and believe the things they do. What the victim was thinking, what the murderer was thinking, and perhaps more important of all what were the investigators, Antoinnette Conway and Steve Moran thinking and what motivates them. I personally would like to see a tighter edit especially towards the end of the book which seemed a little repetitious."
"Two stars means ""it was ok"" according to Goodreads, but this book really was not ok! So sad, I cannot believe Tana French wrote a book I didn't devour with glee. For me, it is soooo boring, and the narrator is too much of a nasty bitter person to spend so much time with. I kept wishing her partner would pop her in the mouth. I've got about 100 pages left, it's due back at the library, and I don't know if I can finish it. The last 50 pages I have been skimming quickly, trying to keep the mean narrator at bay while finding out if anything interesting happens (it didn't!) Tana, I'm sorry, I hope things are good between us again when your next book comes out."
"I debated whether to give this 2 or 3 stars. While there was a good plot and the characters were well developed, the author's writing style was exhausting. The first person narrative could have easily conveyed Conway's inner turmoil, paranoia and lashing out without beating the reader over the head with it. She went on, and on, and on about Conway's feelings and the possible motivations of others. She seemed to feel a need to tell us all the things that could possibly be going on in the mind of every detective and floater in the incident room. The oppressive writing style spoiled what might have otherwise been a pretty good story. "
"So disappointing. I love Tana French and have really liked most of the Dublin Murder Squad books, and even loved a few. This one falls flat. The heroine is extremely annoying, and most of this book is based on Conway and her partner discussing hypothetical leads on a murder case, Conway musing internally about this or that, or them or interrogating witnesses. Nothing much happens. Very slow, and I just didn't like the characters. There ARE a few moments where Conway is philosophizing and I found myself nodding, but overall this just wasn't that interesting. I just finished it less than 2 weeks ago and I don't even remember much about the murder."
"Well, I am not following the herd with this one - why was it rated so highly? I'm unsure, which most of the novel was too. Was it just a straight 'story' or was it a crime thriller'? It is certainly like no crime thriller I've read before and not in a good way. The main character, Antoinette, was so paranoid it was highly irritating and the book seems to run around that premise only - the crime was a tool to expose her paranoia and insecurities - not a good reason to pick up and follow more of her detective adventures in my opinion.

At the end of the day, I won't be recommending this book to anyone sadly."
I listened to the audiobook and really disliked the narrator. Made it really hard to like any of the characters. Seemed a long winded as well. 
"Tana French brings us back again to the Dublin Murder Squad. With a new case that may be more complicated than it seems, a young detective eager to prove herself must contend with her own squad and her past to solve it. Readers of French will savor her flair for being simultaneously clinical and macabre, but may not get quite the fix they've come to expect. The Trespasser is noticeably slower paced and heavier on expositions than previous books in the series."
"I was so excited to see that Tana French had written a new book; I've been devouring her books ever since I stumbled on the first one, but personally, this was my least favorite. I wanted to love it and fully expected to , so was very disappointed. It just didn't have the spark of any of the others and read more like a dreary recitation of police proceedings.
Fingers crossed that this was a one off."
"Let me first say that I give every other one of Tana French's novels 5 stars. I LOVE them like crazy. This one never really hooked me. It's more of a police procedural than an eerie elusive crime or mystery, as her others are. Also, I couldn't quite get connected to the main character here because she was so prickly and angry. The writing is solid as always and the plot has nice twists and turns, but I just wasn't feeling it this time."
"I didn't like this book, which puts it well with others by the same author. Her motto seems to have come from the school of tyro writers, make the reader see, feel, smell and hear what you are conveying. As a result, everything is emphasised and described to the point of degradation, a small tale is tricked out to gargantuan proportions. And what was the point of the unexpected arrival of a relative of Toni's? Seemed a red herring. "
"I'm a little gobsmacked by this book. I liked Into The Woods also written by Tana French but this book was like reading literary quicksand. This was a long, slow, dull slog of a murder mystery complete with the craziest language I have read in many years. It was almost a parody of how someone thinks Dubliners talk with each other. If I took a drink every time Ms. French used the word shite, I would be hustling off to an AA meeting pronto. 2 ⭐️and I think I'm being generous.

"Maybe 2.5. Tana, did your editor quit just before you submitted this to the publisher? Did he run away? Antionette and Steve kept spinning their wheels and repeating themselves for over 250 pages. 250! You sort of picked it up then to the end, but all that self-loathing by Antionette was immature and short-sighted. There were red herrings all over the place. The ending made some sense at least. All that hype, but this didn't live up to it for me. "
"I'm so disappointed that I couldn't get into this because the writing was great, it was too long winded for me. I've given up at 30% as the story wasn't so much about the crime but more about office politics, chauvinism and bullying, something I hadn't expected when I requested it. Also this was my first Dublin Murder Squad book which makes me think that perhaps I should have read the other books in the series first.
Thanks to NetGalley and Hodder & Stoughton for digital copy.
"
"This was going to be a ""Did Not Finish"" book so
many times but I persevered. Nonetheless I found
it rather boring and severely lacking in the
invesitigative realm.
Basically two detectives sit and speculate 'who
did it' Over and Over again ad nauseum.
Ancillary detectives seem only there to irritate
the reader even more. They want to convict
one suspect without any collaborative
evidence. Silly.

I did not like his book."
"After reading the translation of Magda Szabo's book, Iza's Ballad, I struggled to read this poorly written novel. Perhaps, the mystery is enough to grab some but the writing was a complete put off for me.
At this stage in my life, I want to spend my time reading works that are art, sentences that pull me in so much that I want to read them over and over again before turning the page.
I would classify this as a beach read."
"Blah, I should have known if Gillian Flynn was giving her raves. I loved the first few Dublin Murder Squad books but in this one, like the last, the author seems to be trying a different voice- the voice of her protagonist- and it doesn't work. ""In the Woods"", ""The Likeness"", and ""Faithful Place"" are much, much better. The only thing good about this was the vaguely interesting story- though it took WAY too long to unfold- and the Dublin setting. "
"I run hot and cold on the Dublin Murder Squad series. Antoinette Conway, who narrates The Trespasser, wallows in self-pity, suffers delusions of intellectual grandeur, and is an unsympathetic character in general which, come to think of it, I should have suspected in advance by virtue of author Gillian Flynn's glowing praise on the book jacket. This was not the page-turner I was seeking but the story was fairly interesting."
200 pages too long and it was a real task to stay interested. 
This one just bored me. 
"I'd never read any of Tana French's books, and I have to say I admire her skill. I've never been so moved by a murder victim - who didn't have one direct word of dialogue, - yet her story was the most compelling in this extremely talky, drawn-out murder mystery. The protagonist, who did the narration, isn't very likable, has a lot of anger issues. The detective interviews are fascinating. Overall, however, I can only give this 2.5 stars."
"I kept seeing this book, maybe it was the title that called to me. The murder was interesting, so in other words, in plot was good. However, I was disappointed with this book. Maybe I didn't like the main character, she was too paranoid to me. ""The whole squad was out to get me,"" maybe it was because she was a woman and her mother told her too many stories about her father. Wish the main character was, I thought she was a lesbian which would have been more believable. "
"I am a HUGE Tana French fan and have enjoyed many of her books. However, in full disclosure, I couldn't get through this one. I think I made it a bit more than halfway - so my rating is based solely on that. Her writing is always good and the characters are interesting, but I didn't connect with any of them and the story was moving too slowly to keep me engaged. I would still recommend giving it a go if you're a Tana French fan, but this one just wasn't for me."
"First book of French's I didn't absolutely love. Marred for me by exceedingly lengthy dialogues and, most importantly, an over lengthy and exaggerated emphasis on the main character's feelings of being picked on. She became such a one-note that it was hard to care. Could easily have cut a hundred pages out. Pretty well plotted, nice ending. Too much of too much in the middle, though."
"This book was like listening to a person take an hour to tell a story they could have told in 10 minutes. Your listening but thinking ""get there faster"" the whole time. This writers first book was much more suspenseful then those after. This is a very long mystery, not suspense, it's a mystery..a who done it that is worked out in the interview room of a police station. "
"I love this series, but I was actually asking (maybe even begging) Conway (the protagonist) to stop yammering about her life & let's get on with the story through most of the book. However the last 100 pages were bang-up. Maybe I should have just skipped to the end? Sadly, definitely my least favorite in this series. I'm sure the next installment will be better."
"This story never grabbed me. Even remotely. I wasn't in the mood for a protagonist with a persecution complex and felt like the negativity and paranoia just went on and on. The plot, granted, Tana French writes so well that the plot doesn't have to carry the book, was meh. I was not sad when this book ended."
"Normally I love Tana French, but this latest novel didn't measure up to my expectations. I can't really put my finger on why...the story seemed to just go on and on. Most of the dialog takes place in the mind of Antoinette Conroy with her own paranoid views of her career. I'm hoping her next novel gets back to the detective sleuthing that I really enjoy."
"I'm officially over Tana French. I LOVED her first few novels; I loved the creeping suspense and deep characters. With Secret Place and now even more so with The Trespasser, she's skipped the intrigue entirely and barely bothered with character development. What we're left with is a mediocre mystery narrated by a heroine so single-toned it's downright annoying. "
"I'd read the previous books and enjoyed them all however this one, which I listened to on Audible, was completely procedural with endless conversation that took forever to get anywhere. After struggling through 3/4 of the book I gave up and fast forwarded to the end but even that wasn't particularly satisfying. Disappointing."
Disappointing compared to French's other titles. Too much conversation and not much action. Interrogation scenes were way too long and the main characters spent too much time speculating about who and why - very repetitive. Last 100 pages finally got things moving but even then the scenes interrogating McCann went on way too long. 
I have enjoyed all of Tana French's books except this one. I found it ponderous. I could not connect with any of the characters and the writing just did not flow. I gave up on Page 152. Maybe it would have picked up...but to risk 449 pages when there are so many books I want to read I gave myself permission to quit! I will assume the murderer was a Trespasser!
I listened to it on Audible and that was a big mistake! It was narrated by Hilda Fay and I will make sure she isn't narrating my next audio book! She ran every sentence together and it was very difficult to follow. I found it confusing at times to determine what character was supposed to be talking. I will read Tana French's Novel In The Wood the 'old fashioned ' way.
"This was probably my least favorite of Tana French's novels. Primarily because of the narrator who was extremely unlikeable. I did like that it happened over a much shorter time period than her other books, but it felt very slow because the main detective was so self absorbed. "
"I have really liked the previous books by Tana French, but this one was a disappointment for me. Quite unlike any of the others. The main character was extremely unlikeable, and borderline paranoid. The story was quite tedious, with long passages where she brooded on conspiracy theories against her or descriptions of interrogations. So low marks from me."
"Nothing infuriates me more as a reader than a author who decides to write pages after pages of a angry/troubled protagonist's inner monologue.
There is so much distraction from the real plot that you actually believe that this is diary of a angry women in police force.

As for the murder mystery, I really could not bring myself to care."
"I was wishing it would end please from page 300 onwards. I get it it's crime and suspense and stuff but common do you really need to make like 20 different theorys so at the end it wasn't even one of does.
The first pages were good, loved the lady detective but at some point the book started to be about the main detectives crazy imagination.
And franckly the final suck big time."
"I don’t know if this was because I listened to the book, but I did not enjoy it. I found the main character to be too morose, and I had a good guess for the eventual plot twist within the first couple chapters. I’ve enjoyed other books by Tana French but this one just didn’t land for me. I couldn’t wait for it to be over. "
"Відгук від 18/04/2020: Мені не сподобалось. Читаю першу її книгу і за інші точно не візьмусь. Скучно. Ні атмосфери, ні розкриття інших персонажів, ні цікавої кінцівки. Нічого не зачепило. Ну жінка зі стальними яйцями, але якось не вистачає в ній якоїсь слабинки. Дуже посередній детектив. Прочитав - і забув"
"I have loved all of her books, this one was hard to get through. Even at 93% finished, I had to make myself sit down to get to the end. The story and characters were great but just took to long to get there..."
"I was a bit disappointed in this book. Felt like it got very repetitive and the book, in my opinion, was way too long. Finished it just to see how it turned out but I didn't really care that much about the characters. "
"A well plotted murder mystery with lots of detail about the workings of the murder investigation branch of a Dublin police department. The book has received many excellent reviews but I couldn’t get into it. A little over half way through I set it aside. 2 stars
"
"Rambling

After her first three,
Were outstanding, the last one was a bit slow. The Trespasser was work to get through, a disappointment, after I waited months to get my hands on it."
"Nope. I've enjoyed all the other books in the Dublin Murder Squad series, but this one is disappointing. The plot is much weaker than her other novels, and I found Detective Conway utterly unlikable in this story, and found it hard to work up any sympathy for her ordeals. Pass."
"I didn't like this one as much as some of the other Dublin Murder Squad books. I didn't really connect with the characters, it took a VERY long time to get going and in the end, the mystery part was only OK."
"I have read every one of the DMS books, and this is the weakest and dullest of the series. I spent 400+ pages reading about two ""eejit"" detectives who speculate back and forth on whodunit theories. The whole plot seemed to take place in the fucking police interview room. It was disappointing."
"I hate to say it but this one goes near the bottom in terms of Tana French's books. It was extremely slow, the mystery wasn't as exciting as her others, and the protagonist was hard to warm up to. I was anticipating this one with such excitement, but sadly it really did not meet expectations. "
"This is a police procedural with a capital ""P."" The reader is privy to the narrator's every thought and every self doubt (of which there are many). This can make the 449 pages a slog at times -- no surprises here but steady thorough book."
"I'm only giving this two starts because I've enjoyed the author's past books and her writing is still rich and enjoyable in places. However, this book took so long to read and felt so plodding. Even when it ended it just felt, ""eh"". I don't recommend this book at all. "
I had to go back and write about this one. It was really long for what ended up happening in this one. I got bogged down in it for awhile. I love Tana French but this was not her strongest effort in my opinion. It was wordy and I think that took away from the plot at times. 
"I've read all of French's books and have liked all of them, up until now. This story is very slow, mostly because there is too much extraneous information. I only kept reading because I did want to find out ""whodunnit""."
"Sooooo slow! About 100 pages too many.
It took me over a month to finish this book and I normally would have put it down but I wanted to give Tana French the benefit of the doubt. I am liking her books less and less each one that comes out, but this was better than the last one set at the school.
"
"I found this disappointing, just OK. French's first 3-4 books were outstanding, and the last few have just not been as good. I continue to enjoy the world, the Irish vernacular and accents (I switched to audio on her books), but this one just seemed disjointed and way longer than it needed to be. "
"Disappointed overall with this book. The story felt slow and I wasn't compelled to read more than one chapter at a time because the story never really ""hooked"" me in. This was my first Tana French novel so I hope that the next I read is better! "
"If I hadn't wanted to find who was the perpetrator in this mystery, I wouldn't have read it in t he first place. It was set somewhere across the pond, and a lot of the language was quite unfamiliar. Much of the book plodded along, and I can't recommend it. "
"I thought this book was incredibly long on the audiobook edition. Also, being quite wordy, made me start daydreaming while the book is playing on. ""The Trespasser"" does not make me want to delve into any additional Tana French authored titles."
"I read 30% of it, which maybe counts as reading it. I like the characters in this one much more than the last, but I've been reading the sloooow mysteries of this series for too long to have the patience to keep going. We'll see if I ever return."
"I really like Tana French, and this one was a page-turner, no doubt. But the main character was just....so....whiny. I closed the book thinking, that's it???"
Not as good as her other books.....too too long...
So disappointing. Lackluster and plodding compared to her other books. 
"This was not near as good a read as her other books.
"
"wasted two weeks on this tripe. not like other French novels at all. flat characters, a mystery/victim I didn't care about, and an underwhelming resolution. don't bother."
2.5 stars. This book dragged on and on and wasn't really interesting until the last 50 pages or so. The main character was whiny and spent way too much energy thinking everyone was out to get her.
"I was in the mood for a thriller.....that's not what I got. Found this book difficult to like, but I hung in there and it didn't get any better. "
I tried to read this novel for almost a month. I just could not get into it. I found I just didn't care who killed the vapid victim or why. Too many other good books out there to read.
2.5 When I dislike the main character I dislike the book.
"so not as good as I expected...ok, maybe I would give it 2.5 stars, but it just didn't live up to her last books."
Long book for simple story. 
I couldn't get in to it. Too long and strung out. 
"Overall, good and entertaining. Many plot twists to keep you quessing who might be at fault. "
DNF. Very specific details made this book extremely slow paced. 
"It seemed to go on forever, repetitive."
Really struggled with this one and I usually like Tana French.
Far too long and a bit clichéd for my liking. But definitely a page turner with lots of twists and turns.
Didn't get grabbed by this book until 60% in...unusual for this author.
"Boring

I found this book to be very slow and redundant. It could have been much shorter if so much info wasn't repeated.
I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
Moved way too slowly. Lost interest and skimmed to end. No more Tana French.
On and on and on
A lot of words that add up to not much of a story...
Not her best.
Not as good as others. 
"It took way too long for the characters to solve the crime. The book was about 100 pages too long, and I really struggled to finish the book."
The story was interesting it just took forever. The editor should have trimmed off about 100 pages. 
"Disappointed because really liked Tana's other books. This one is too long, confusing, boring and painful to finish."
"This book made me realize I am not a fan of crime novels. I wanted it to end about 200 pages before it did. By that point, I didn't CARE who murdered the woman anymore. "
"Not as good as her other books. I was a huge fan until this book. I think French needed a good editor. Much too long. I highly recommend ""Broken Harbor"" and ""In the Woods."" Both excellent."
I was disappointed in this book. I've read previous books by this author and thought I was in for a treat. Gave up half way through.
"Book was ok. Very police policy, versus a actual story. I enjoyed it but would't buy it for my bestie. "
2.5.
Not as good as her previous novels.
"Aburridísimo, se pierde constantemente por derroteros que no aportan nada a la investigación. Me lo terminé porque me daba cosa dejarlo pero más de la mitad de las páginas son innecesarias "
Wayyyyyy to long. Majority of the beginning of the book was boring the last 200 pages were really good and kept my actual interest.
Unfortunately the Audiobook app froze half-way through the book and I had to reset it and lost the book. Will try again at some other time
"took me months to finish, I was holding out for it to get interesting. spoiler: it doesn't. Grossly underwhelming in comparison to her other books."
In English 
My least favorite of French's novels. It was difficult for me to get into.
A young woman is killed in her home while preparing dinner for her boyfriend. The murder squad looks at the boyfriend as the possible killer. Eventually they find the unexpected real killer. The book is too slow moving and too long. I don't expect to read any more of French's novels.
"I'm a fan of this author, but The Trespasser doesn't measure up to her other novels, I don't think. It takes a long time to move through, and Conway's tough-girl character is overdone to the point of stereotype. That said, I do like French's exploration of the psychology of what it's like to be a woman in a male-dominated work environment. "
Will review after book club 
"This is the third Tana French book I have started, skimmed, then read the last twenty pages. That is, my final Tana French attempt. People love her, but it's not for me. Give me a Laura Lippmann mystery any day over a French mystery. Sorry. I feel like I have to apologize for not liking this author. "
Don't waste your time.
"I can only handle so much she-knew-in-her-gut detective work. I get that detectives have a good sense of intuition, but this story was based almost entirely on the reading of micro-expressions and gut feelings. Even on the occasion when Conway's gut feelings didn't pan out, they were still the driving force behind her (and apparently every detective's) ability to solve cases and I just don't buy it.

In the Woods was my introduction to Tana French and I loved it. Since then I've read The Likeness and now The Trespasser and the last two have required too much suspension of disbelief on my part. I might come back to the Dublin Murder Squad at some point in the future, but for now I'm done."
"I enjoyed the Irish setting & dialog very much. The overall plot was not too exciting for me, however."
"This book for me just kept going and going. I kept thinking ""just get to the point"". I skimmed over a lot. Disappointed."
"Enjoyed the main character immensely.

This was a sharply written character driven novel the went off the rails in the last 1/3 and ended up as only average."
Did not like the main character. Had to stick with it at times. Finally got better toward the end.
Listened to LONG audiobook. Narrator was terrible. The story was hard to evaluate because the narrator was so bad. I have a feeling the story was a 3. 
I made it through this one despite the salty language and protagonist's paranoia. Probably won't read another one just because it's depressing being in her head. The narrator has a great Irish accent that makes it worth listening to the audiobook.
I started to read this book but I quickly got confused by the characters language. I like the plot and the characters but the use of the native terms and words had me a bit confused. Maybe if I had started at the beginning of the series it would have been different. I was not able to follow the characters close enough and spent too much time trying to figure out what they were trying to say and losing the plot place in the process. I usually do not have such a problem. I did not finish this book I am sorry to say but I wish I had.
